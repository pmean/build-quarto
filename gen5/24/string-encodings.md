::: notes

Once you go beyong the original 128 ASCII characters that have been with us for many decades, things get tricky. This blog post talks about the development of encodings of extended character sets beyond the original 128 and how to work with the encodings.

Another historical overview of encoding is on [YouTube][ref-beattie-2023].
