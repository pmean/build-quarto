::: notes

While there are several websites that offer repositories for datasets associated with peer-reviewed publications, this one seems to offer a better set of choices: full and complete datasets rather than just summary tables. This is part of the [Generalist Repository Ecosystem Initiative][ref-nih-nodate], an NIH funded initiative to enable better sharing of research data.
