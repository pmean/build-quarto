::: notes

An [article][now1] in the Journal of Statistics Education describes the development of a repository for real-world datasets associated with actual peer-reviewed publications. You have to fill out a short form agreeing not to do bad things with the data before downloading any of these datasets. Each dataset has a nice data dictionary.
