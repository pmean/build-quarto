I'm submitting a talk to [an upcoming research
conference](http://www.k-state.edu/stats/news/IDAD%202018.html). I'm not
sure if they'll accept it, but wish me luck. Here's the title and
abstract.

Mining the Electronic Health Record, Why and How.

Stephen D. Simon, Department of Biomedical and Health Informatics, UMKC

Medical records are now stored electronically, allowing opportunities
for research and quality improvement studies that did not exist before.
In this talk, I will review the extraction of information into i2b2, a
database that is scrubbed of personal identifiers, and will discuss the
strengths and limitations of this data compared to other commonly used
health care data sets. I will also show a simple example of creating a
medical record phenotype and validating it against a tumor registry.
