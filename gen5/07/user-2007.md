I may not be able to go to it, but the R community has an annual meeting, useR!, that will be held this year in Ames, Iowa from August 8-10. The web site for this conference ([user2007.org][use1]) provides some of the details.

Previous conferences were held in Vienna, Austria, which is a bit further away, but also a bit more exotic.

Earlier versions are [here][sim1] and [here][sim2].
