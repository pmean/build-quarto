::: notes

I am [upgrading and consolidating][sim3a] my [website][sim5] and [blog][sim6] to [blogdown][blog1], an R package based on [Hugo][hugo1]. My website is currently hosted by Ionos (formerly 1-and-1). Ionos is offering a new system, Deploy Now, that allows you to deploy static sites directly from GitHub. It also can deploy PHP, though that is not of relevance to me. This website provides an introduction to how Deploy Now works.

I may end up using this in the future, though I need to research it a bit first.

Ionos. Deploy Now. Available in [html format][ion1].
