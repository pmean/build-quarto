*Dear Professor Mean, I found a journal article with a confidence interval that was asymmetric. For example, the authors reported a mortality difference of 5% and a 95% confidence interval of -1.2% to 12%. I can't understand how the CI can be unequally distributed if it uses the form ESTIMATE +/- 1.96 * STANDARD ERROR.

**Not every confidence interval uses a plus or minus type formula**. The ones that don't are usually asymmetric. In particular, **most confidence intervals involving ratios are asymemmetric** (though some of them are symmetric on a log scale). Also **confidence intervals that take the small sample sizes into account are often asymmetric**. It's good that you remember your confidence interval formula from your Statistics class, but your instructor probably didn't have time to show you every possible confidence interval formula.
