Dear Professor Mean,

*When should you use a weighted mean?* 

Loyal Reader

<!---more--->

Dear Reader,

Weighted means are used in a variety of settings. it's hard to define all the possible settings, but here are a few common ones.

1. When a data point represents the contributions of a variable number of patients.

2. When some data points are more variable/less variable than other data points.

3. When certain demographic groups are over or under represented.

4. For complex samping schemes.
