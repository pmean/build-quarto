The Department of Continuing Education at Oxford University offers an interesting range of short courses on Evidence-Based Health Care. They had a recent call for feedback on a new course that they would like to offer on Research Integrity and Open Science.

The topics that they plan to cover in the course include many that I have talked out on these web pages. They asked for feedback in a survey. It is mostly, I suspect, an effort to identify students for this class. But I took the survey and made a bold pitch to be a speaker. I don't think this will be successful, but you have to try. Here is what I wrote.

## To the question "Are there any speakers you would like to see invited on this module? Do you have any contacts/suggestions for these?"

At the risk of sounding arrogant, I myself would be a good speaker. I have written a lot informally about data sharing, data documentation, and open source publishing. I have written up multiple case studies in research fraud, data privacy, and conflicts of interest. Some of my work was published on a Wiki site, Chance News, which unfortunately seems to have fallen off the Internet. But you can get a rough idea of the topics by the titles of my [contributions][ref-wiki]. I also have pages on my own website about [data sharing][ref-sharing], [conflict of interest][ref-coi], [open source][ref-open], [reproducible research][ref-reproducible], and many others. My website is in transition, so many of the pages are broken, but you can get a rough idea of what I have written about. Half of my pages are original content and half are links to other interesting websites and journal articles.

I would be thrilled to get a chance to speak more about this topic. I am also willing to work behind the scenes, reviewing materials produced by others.

## To the question "Are there any case studies that you would like to examine in more depth within the module?"

The Netflix data competition is a nice introduction to data privacy.

The Reinhart-Rogoff Excel error is a cautionary tale about reproducibility.

The investigations of Keith Baggerly and Kevin Coombes into the Duke University scandal
