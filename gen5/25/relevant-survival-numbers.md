::: notes
While the hazard ratio is difficult to interpret, there are, according to Stephen Senn, problems with the alternatives (median survival time and probability of surviving to a certain point). I'm not sure that I agree with Stephen Senn or with the article that he cites, but it is definitely worth noting.
