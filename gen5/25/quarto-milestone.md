Over the 27 years that this website has been in existence, I have used a variety of different software systems to produce web pages. In 2019, I decided to unite these disparate sources using blogdown. That transition has taken more time than I would have expected. I had got about half to two-thrids of the pages at least partially transitioned, but it was rather painful.

In 2024, I decide to switch to quarto, both the files that had already transitioned to blogdown and the files that had not transitioned. That has not been totally painless, but it has been easier than the transition to blogdown.

I reached an important milestone a few days ago. Every blogdown file is now a quarto file. I also transitioned some (not many) of the earlier files to quarto. I now have 2,249 quarto files. The average word count is 380 which puts the total word count to well over 8 hundred thousand words.

There's still a lot of work to do, but I am seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. Everytime I complete a page in quarto, I try to replace the earlier page with a brief pointer to the new page. This is an oddly satisfying thing to do. It feels like cleaning up in a room that has been neglected for a long time.
