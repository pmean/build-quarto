"In a world where the price of calculation continues to decrease rapidly, but the price of theorem proving continues to hold steady or increase, elementary economics indicates that we ought to spend a larger and larger fraction of our time on calculation." John Tukey, as quoted in "Sunset Salvo", The American Statistician 1986; 40(10): 72-76. This article is behind a paywall. Sorry!
