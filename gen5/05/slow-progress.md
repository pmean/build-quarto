You may have noticed how few entries there are in the month of
November. That's just a reflection of the extraordinary surge in work
here at Children's Mercy Hospital. There's lots of things that I
wanted to write for this weblog, but there just isn't any free time
recently. I'm hoping that things settle down to a more normal pace
soon and I can get back to writing an entry here every other day or
so.
