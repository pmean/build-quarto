A physician here, Lloyd Olson, who has been aggressively promoting Evidence Based Medicine suggested the following interesting article on practice guidelines.

- **Are guidelines following guidelines? The methodological quality of clinical practice guidelines in the peer-reviewed medical literature.** Shaneyfelt TM, Mayo-Smith MF, Rothwangl J. Jama 1999: 281(20); 1900-5.

According to the article, practice guidelines are

*"systematically developed statements to assist practitioner and patient decisions about appropriate health care for specific clinical circumstances."*

The article evaluated 279 guidelines published between 1985 and 1997 on a list of 25 items:

1.  *Purpose of the guideline is specified.*
2.  *Rationale and importance of the guideline are explained.*
3.  *The participants in the guideline development process and their area of expertise are specified.*
4.  *Targeted health problem or technology is clearly defined.*
5.  *Targeted patient population is specified.*
6.  *Intended audience or users of the guideline are specified.*
7.  *The principal preventive, diagnostic, or therapeutic options available to clinicians and patients are specified.*
8.  *The health outcomes are specified.*
9.  *The method by which the guideline underwent external review is specified.*
10. *An expiration date or date of scheduled review is specified.*
11. *Method of identifying scientific evidence is specified.*
12. *Time period from which evidence is reviewed is specified.*
13. *The evidence used is identified by citation and referenced.*
14. *Method of data extraction is specified.*
15. *Method for grading or classifying the scientific evidence is specified.*
16. *Formal methods of combining evidence or expert opinion are used and described.*
17. *Benefits and harms of specific health practices are specified.*
18. *Benefits and harms are quantified.*
19. *The effect on health care costs from specific health practices is specified.*
20. *Costs are quantified.*
21. *The role of value judgments used by the guideline developers in making recommendation is discussed.*
22. *The role of patient preferences is discussed.*
23. *Recommendations are specific and apply to the stated goals of the guideline.*
24. *Recomendations are graded according to the strength of the evidence.*
25. *Flexibility in the recommendations is specified.*

Although there are some improvement over time, the overall degree of compliance with these items was still only about half in 1997.
