Propensity scores represent an intriguing alternative method to reduce the impact of confounding variables, especially when there are multiple potential confounding variables. This paper considers a range of models comparing the propensity score approach to the more traditional approaches of adjusting for confounders. I think the conclusions are overly simplistic, but the paper is still worth reading.
