I am working on a project that has a series of files in R and R Markdown, and I need to track down where a particular function was originally defined. In Unix based systems, this is pretty easy to do.

<!---More--->

There's a built in function, grep, that does the job. So

grep "string" \*.\*

will find and list the occurences of "string" in every file in your current directory. There are lots of variations, type

grep --help

for details. The real computer nerds already know this, but I'm just getting started with Unix based commands.
