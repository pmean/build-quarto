This page provides resources for a small booklet I have developed, "An introduction to diagnostic testing." I have printed a few of these booklets and attached a fully constructed version of the likelihood ratio slide rule. If you are teaching a class and want to incorporate this material, I am willing to offer a reasonable number of copies of this for free. In exchange, I'd like you to offer some feedback about this booklet. Eventually, I want to expand this into a larger project, possibly a book.

If you want to download this material directly, please note that I have links to some of these resources.

+ a [PDF version][sli1] of the booklet,
+ a [PDF image][sli2] of the likelihood ratio slide rule with instructions on how to construct it,
+ [examples][sli3] of how to use the likelihood ratio slide rule
+ an [annotated bibliography][sli4] with links to the full free text when available, and
+ [links to pages][sli5] on my site that I used to create this booklet.
