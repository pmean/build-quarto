Max Kuhn and Julia Slige present a detailed tutorial on some recent advances in R that help you build the best statistical model for your data. This includes the difficult task of choosing between competing modeling approaches. The authors use the "tidyverse" approach in their work, and offer a brief review of tidyverse principles as part of this document.
