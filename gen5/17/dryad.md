I've been looking for something like this for a while. It is a repository for data sets associated with peer-reveiwed publicattions. I have only glanced at it briefly, but it looks fairly easy to use with a fair number of interesting data sets/publications.

Dryad Digital Respository. Available in [html format][dry1].
