This project is a collaborative effort to find clinical trials used in regulatory decision making and replicate the results using real-world evidence (observational studies using large databases such as electronic health records, claims and billing records, or product and disease registries). The goal is to understand when real-world evidence works well at replicating clinical trials, when it does not, and why.
