I usually do not recommend commercial products, as I know most of you have very limited funds. But when it comes to grants, you should consider paying for good training. The best grant writing class I ever took was from David Morrison, who is part of Grant Writers Seminars and Workshops. Also good are the seminars produced by the Grant Training Center. Details on both groups are listed below.
