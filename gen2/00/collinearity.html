<p><strong>What is collinearity? (created 2000-01-27)</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/what-is-collinearity/">new website</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Dear Professor Mean, Could you describe the term collinearity for me? I understand that it 
 has to do with variables which are not totally independent, but that is all I know!</em></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Collinearity is a situation where there is close to a near perfect linear relationship 
       among some or all of the independent variables in a regression model. In practical terms, 
       this means there is <strong>some degree of redundancy or overlap</strong> among your 
       variables.</p>
       <p>Some authors describe this as multicollinearity, near collinearity, or ill conditioning. 
       Coming up with four different technical terms for the same condition is one way that we 
       statisticians keep our discipline mysterious and awe inspiring.</p>
       <p>Collinearity can appear as a <strong>very high correlation</strong> among two independent 
       variables, but it doesn't have to work that way. Another type of collinearity is when <strong>
       several of the variables add up to something that it very close to a constant</strong> value.</p>
       <p>Collinearity is not a fatal flaw, but it does cause a <strong>loss in power</strong> and 
       it <strong>makes interpretation more difficult</strong>.</p>
       <p>A simple example of collinearity is when you are using both <strong>gestational age</strong> 
       and <strong>birth weight</strong> as independent variables. These two measures are highly 
       correlated, of course, since low gestational ages tend to be associated with low birth 
       weights.</p>
       <p>Interpretation is difficult in this situation, because when both variables are in a 
       regression model, the parameter for birth weight is measuring the effect of a change in one 
       unit in birth weight on the dependent variable, assuming that all of the other variables are 
       held constant. <strong>It's hard to envision what it means to change birth weight while 
       gestational age is held constant</strong>. What you are looking at, in effect, is the size of 
       a baby for a gestational age.</p>
       <p>Collinearity also causes a loss in power. <strong>When you have overlap among some of the 
       variables, it takes more data to disentangle the individual effects of these variables</strong>. 
       Think of it as a table where you push two of the four legs away from the corners and close to 
       the middle of the table. Such a table will be very unstable.</p>
       <p>In the previous example, we have very few 1000 gram babies who are 40 weeks gestational 
       age and very few 2500 gram babies who are 32 weeks gestational age. Without data at these two 
       &quot;corners&quot; of the table, it's hard to get stable statistical estimates.</p>
       <p>It should be noted, though, that <strong>you can make sense of your data, even when you 
       have collinearity</strong>. It just takes more data and a bit of care in interpretation. Some 
       health outcomes, it turns out, are related more closely to gestational age than to birth 
       weight. It's not how small you are that is as important as how early you make your entry into 
       the world. Keep in mind that I'm not a doctor (see my <a href="disclaimer.html">
       disclaimer</a>), so check my limited knowledge of medicine out with the experts. Especially 
       if you are a newborn baby.</p>
