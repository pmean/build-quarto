<p><strong>Sigma in the control chart.</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/control-chart-sigma/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I ran a control chart in SPSS for individual values, 
 and the control limits don't correspond with what I would expect from the 
 descriptive procedure that I ran first. In particular, the value of sigma in 
 the control chart appears to be an approximation of what I computed earlier. 
 Why would SPSS use a different calculation for sigma?</em></p>
<p>The use of the word &quot;sigma&quot; in quality control circles is different than 
   how it is used in other circles. So the sigma limits that you get in your 
   control chart are different than what you would get in any other descriptive 
   statistics procedure. In particular, sigma represents neither the sample 
   standard deviation, nor the standard error of the mean.</p>
<p>The reason the sigma in a control chart differs from any of the numbers you 
   might get in a descriptive summary is that: </p>
<p>1. In a control chart, sigma represents short term variation only. If sigma 
   included long term variation, then it would be too big. It would include 
   things like a slow drift or trend that would inflate the limits and make the 
   control chart useless.</p>
<p>2. In a control chart, sigma is corrected for bias. The correction factor 
   is more complicated than the &quot;n-1&quot; factor which makes the variance (but not 
   the standard deviation) unbiased. </p>
<p>3. In this particular control chart, the moving range is used to 
   approximate sigma. The moving range is not used either directly or indirectly 
   in other descriptive summaries. Keep in mind also that a moving range is only 
   meaningful if there is a natural time sequence to your data (as would have to 
   be the case for a control chart). Many of the data sets that might be 
   summarized in a descriptive procedure would not have a natural time sequence.

   explain this material far better than I can.</p>
