<p><strong>Causation.</strong></p>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, Everyone says that 
 smoking causes cancer, but we can't really say that, can we? There is an 
 association between smoking and cancer, but we know that association does not 
 imply causation, don't we?</font></em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You point out that an <strong>association is 
   not always causation</strong>. This is indeed correct, <strong>but sometimes 
   association IS causation</strong>. For example, standing under trees during a 
   storm is associated with getting struck by lightning. If you think that 
   association can never imply causation, I invite you to stand under a tall 
   tree the next time there is a storm.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">No, no come back here. I didn't mean it. You 
   do pose an interesting question: <strong>when does association imply 
   causation?</strong></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Short explanation</font></strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A good review of when we can make the leap 
   from association to causation is a 1965 article by Sir Austin Bradford Hill 
   &quot;The Environment and Disease: Association or Causation&quot;. He mentions nine 
   factors:</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Strength (is the risk so large that we can 
    easily rule out other factors)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Consistency (have the results have been 
    replicated by different researchers and under different conditions)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Specificity (is the exposure associated 
    with a very specific disease as opposed to a wide range of diseases)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Temporality (did the exposure precede the 
    disease)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Biological gradient (are increasing 
    exposures associated with increasing risks of disease)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Plausibility (is there a credible 
    scientific mechanism that can explain the association)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Coherence (is the association consistent 
    with the natural history of the disease)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Experimental evidence (does a physical 
    intervention show results consistent with the association)</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Analogy (is there a similar result that we 
    can draw a relationship to)</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Example</font></strong></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's look at these nine factors with respect 
   to smoking.</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">There certainly is a <strong>strong 
    association</strong>.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">The results are <strong>consistent</strong> 
    across a wide range of researchers and studies.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Smoking is <strong>not specific</strong> as 
    it is associated with a wide range of diseases besides cancer.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Smoking precedes the diagnosis of 
    cancer</strong>, sometimes by several decades. By the way, some 
    statisticians did try to make an argument that cancer causes smoking (people 
    who have a genetic predisposition to cancer are the ones who are readily 
    attracted to and addicted by cigarettes), but that argument was easily 
    demolished.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">There is a <strong>dose response</strong> 
    relationship (heavy smokers are at greater risk than light smokers).</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">I'm not sure if we know enough about cancer 
    to provide a specific <strong>mechanism</strong>. Perhaps we can invoke some 
    of the ideas we know about how certain chemicals can cause DNA damage.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">There is <strong>coherence</strong> in that 
    lung cancer rates rise with smoking rates and the rates are higher in 
    countries where a lot of people smoke.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Experimental interventions</strong> 
    do work. Getting people to quit smoking has been shown to greatly reduce 
    their risk for cancer.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">I'm not aware of <strong>analogy</strong> 
    to smoking. Perhaps the fact that cigar smoking and pipe smoking are 
    associated with cancers of the mouth.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">So that's anywhere from six to eight out of 
   nine, which makes <strong>a convincing case for causation</strong>. Someone 
   who knows more about the mechanisms of cancer could comment about 
   plausibility and about analogous relationships.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are nine conditions that you should examine when deciding whether 
   statistical association implies causation.</p>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">strength,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">consistency,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">specificity,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">temporality,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">biological gradient,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">plausibility,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">coherence,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">experimental evidence, and</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">analogy.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p>None of these criteria are perfect, but they give a useful guideline. As
   <font face="Times New Roman">Sir Austin Bradford Hill himself notes:</font></p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><font color="#FF0000"><i>&quot;All scientific work is incomplete- whether it 
     be observational or experimental. All scientific work is liable to be upset 
     or modified by advancing knowledge. This does not confer upon a freedom to 
     ignore the knowledge we already have, or to postpone the action that it 
     appears to demand at a given time. Who knows, asked Robert Browning, but 
     that the world may end to-night? True, but on available evidence most of us 
     make ready to commute on the 8.30 next day.&quot;</i></font></p>
