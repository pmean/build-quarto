<p><strong>Regression to the mean (created 2000-01-27).</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/regression-to-the-mean/">new website</a>.</p>

  <p><em>Dear Professor Mean, In a stat course I was introduced to the term &quot;regression to the 
  mean&quot;. Today we administered a pretest to 4th graders. In Feb we will again test, with the same 
  exam, to see &quot;how much they've learned&quot;. I explained to the principal that, of course they would 
  do better, no matter how well they were taught, that this was a classic case of regression to the 
 mean. Am I correct, close, or way off on this?</em></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>You're half right, but Professor Mean doesn't give partial credit.</p>
       <p><strong>Regression to the mean can explain how individuals behave, but it does not usually 
       characterize how groups of individuals behave</strong>. The one exception is when the group 
       is selected on the basis of one of the variables.</p>
       <p>It might help to remember the application where the concept of regression to the mean was 
       first discovered. <strong>Sir Francis Galton was interested in the relationship between a 
       child's height (when the child reaches adulthood) and the height of the parents</strong>. 
       There are several ways to look at the data: the height of the father versus the height of the 
       child, the height of the mother versus the height of the child, or the average height of both 
       parents versus the height of the child.</p>
       <p>One example, described on page 169 of Friedman, Pisani and Purves (1998), examines the 
       relationship between the height of the father and the height of a male child. For this data, 
       the correlation was 0.5. When you look at the prediction equation, though, the results at 
       first seem a bit counterintuitive. <strong>Without knowing anything else, you might expect 
       that the best prediction for a male child's height would be the father's height</strong>. In 
       other words, if the father is 74 inches, your best prediction of the male child's height 
       would also be 74 inches.</p>
       <p>It doesn't quite work out that way, partly because <strong>the average child's height (69 
       inches) was one inch greater than the average father's height (68 inches)</strong>. That may 
       be due to better nutrition or some other environmental factor. Both groups did have the same 
       standard deviation, though (2.7).</p>
       <p><img border="0" src="../03/images/rtm3.gif" align="right" width="231" height="248">Another surprising finding was that
       <strong>the slope of the regression line was 0.5 rather than 1.0</strong>. What does this 
       mean? If the father's height is above average, say by six inches, the child's height would be 
       expected to be above average, but to a lesser degree (three inches). If the father's height 
       was below average, say by four inches, the child's height would also be expected to be below 
       average but by only two inches.</p>
       <p>So the rule for predicting child height is this. <strong>Note how much the father's height 
       deviates from the father mean of 68 inches. Cut that deviation in half. That tells you how 
       much you would expect the child's height to deviate from the child mean of 69 inches.</strong> 
       For example, suppose a father's height is 72 inches. This is 4 inches above the father mean 
       of 68. We would expect the child's height to be only 2 inches above the child mean of 69 
       inches. This means that 71 inches is our best prediction of the child's height.</p>
       <p><img border="0" src="../03/images/rtm4.gif" align="left" width="320" height="320">This is the classic example of 
       regression to the mean. <strong>Tall fathers tend to have tall children, but not usually as 
       tall as they are. Short fathers tend to have short children, but not usually as short as they 
       are</strong>. This doesn't ALWAYS hold true, of course. There are some tall fathers who 
       produce even taller children; there are some short fathers who produce even shorter children. 
       But the general tendency is for the children to have heights slightly closer to the mean than 
       their fathers.</p>
       <p>The same general tendencies hold, by the way, when you look at the mother's height, or the 
       average of father's and mother's height.</p>
       <p>Now keep in mind that regression to the mean informs you about individual deviations from 
       the group average. The children in the Galton's example as a whole were one inch taller than 
       the fathers. Regression to the mean doesn't tell us anything about how an entire generation 
       differs from the generation before it. What it tells us is how individuals deviate from the 
       mean of their group.</p>
       <p>The same thing might happen in your data set. <strong>Suppose the average student scores 
       50 at the start of classes and 70 at the end of classes</strong>. Then regression to the mean 
       will tell you how much students deviate from the mean of 70 at the end of classes on the 
       basis of how much they deviated from the mean of 50 at the beginning of classes.</p>
       <p><strong>A student who is one standard deviation above the average score of 50 at the start 
       of classes is probably going to be a bit less than a full standard deviation above average 
       score of 70 at the end of classes</strong>. So you might be a bit disappointed with students 
       in the &quot;smart&quot; class.</p>
       <p><strong>A student who is one standard deviation below the average score of 50 at the start 
       of classes is probably going to be a bit less than one standard deviation below the average 
       score of 70 at the end of classes</strong>. You might get encouraged by students in the 
       &quot;dumb&quot; class.</p>
       <p><strong>Where regression to the mean tends to cause unexpected results is when you select 
       students on the basis of their pre-test values</strong>. For example, a naive researcher 
       might split a sample of students into a &quot;smart&quot; class and a &quot;dumb&quot; class on the basis of a 
       preliminary test. There might be, say a 10 point gap between the two groups based on the 
       preliminary test. But all other things being equal, you should expect the gap between the 
       &quot;smart&quot; and the &quot;dumb&quot; class to be narrower by the end of the year.</p>
       <p>Of course, you don't use terms like &quot;smart&quot; and &quot;dumb&quot; for your students. The point here 
       is that if you segregate students on the basis of their performance at the start of the 
       class, the amount the two groups appear to learn at the end of classes will vary even if 
       nothing else differs between the two groups.</p>
       <p><strong>Regression to the mean also can appear in medical settings</strong>. Quite often 
       we will segregate patients into &quot;sick&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; categories on the basis of some medical 
       test. If we re-tested these groups at a later date, we would probably see that the &quot;sick&quot; 
       category probably isn't quite as sick as we thought they were and the &quot;healthy&quot; category 
       probably isn't as healthy as we thought they were.</p>
       <p><strong>Suppose we measure cholesterol levels in 100 patients and select the 50 patients 
       with above average cholesterol levels for a special diet and exercise program</strong>. Even 
       if that program were entirely ineffective, you would probably see some level of cholesterol 
       reduction. The change would have been balanced out by the 50 patients in the below average 
       group who would probably show an increase on average if we had taken the time and trouble to 
       follow them as well.</p>
       <p>Sometimes patients will self-select themselves for a new treatment. Some illnesses are 
       cyclical, with random peaks and troughs in how the patient feels. <strong>Patients are most 
       likely to adopt a new approach (change doctors, discontinue medication, etc.) when they are 
       in a trough. When the inevitable rebound occurs, the patient might falsely attribute the 
       rebound to the change in treatment</strong>. This is especially true when the patient focuses 
       on a small time scale.</p>

  <p><b>Some special situations</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p><b>Some processes show a natural progression in the averages, and we would expect a 
       roughly similar progression in individual values.</b> For example, almost all children 
       grow--short children grow and tall children grow too. So, for example, a three year old child 
       with a height above the average of all three year olds will, after a year, grow (maybe a 
       little and maybe a lot). This pretty much guarantees that, at the age of four, this child 
       will be even farther above the average height of all three year olds. That's not surprising 
       and it is not a contradiction of regression to the mean. What you have to do, of course, is 
       to look at that child's height relative to all four year old children.</p>
       <p><b>When there is a natural progression in averages, regression to the mean is chasing a 
       moving target.</b> If you select a group of normal healthy three year old children who all 
       have heights above the average of all three year olds, then after a year, they will have 
       heights that are above the average of all four year olds, but possibly by a smaller amount. 
       Similarly, a group of sixth grade children who read at levels above the average of all sixth 
       graders, will probably read at an even higher level a year later. But you would need to 
       compare them, after a year, to the average reading level of all seventh graders.</p>
       <p>Also, <b>regression to the mean for individuals on the low end will tend to balance out 
       regression to the mean for individuals on the high end</b>. So, if you select an average or 
       unremarkable group of individuals, and there is no preferential selection of individuals 
       above average and no screening or exclusion of individuals who are below average, then that 
       group, as a whole, will not exhibit regression to the mean.</p>
       <p>Finally, <b>regression to the mean is a statistical tendency, so there will always be 
       exceptions</b>. There will be some individuals who are above average at baseline and even 
       more above average at the end of the study. It's also possible, once in a while for an entire 
       group to move in a direction opposite of what regression to the mean would tell you. After 
       all, any time you have randomness, unpredictable things can happen.</p>
