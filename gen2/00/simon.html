<p>Here's some personal information about me.</p>
<p>I work at <a href="http://www.childrensmercy.org">Children's Mercy Hospital</a> 
 (CMH) in
 <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Regional/U_S__States/Missouri/Cities/Kansas_City/">
 Kansas City</a> as a Biostatistician. I work in the
 <a href="http://www.cmh.edu/Research/MedRes.HTM">Office of Medical Research</a> 
 and am supervised by <a href="http://www.cmh.edu/Research/Staff/Kauffman.HTM">
 Dr. Ralph Kauffman</a>.</p>
<p>Before I came to CMH, I worked for the
 <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/homepage.html">National Institute for 
 Occupational Safety and Health</a>. I also have experience in teaching at
 <a href="http://www.bgsu.edu/">Bowling Green State University</a>.</p>
<p>My B.A., M.S., and Ph.D. all come from the <a href="http://www.uiowa.edu/">
 University of Iowa</a>. The latter two degrees came from the
 <a href="http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/">Department of Statistics and Actuarial 
 Science</a>. My Dissertation Advisor,
 <a href="http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/">Dr. Russell V. Lenth</a>, has a 
 very nice home page with some interesting information about
 <a href="http://www.stat.uiowa.edu/~rlenth/Power/index.html">sample size and 
 power calculations</a>.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="http://www.cmh.edu/Research/Staff/Simon.HTM">mug shot of 
 me</a> on the CMH web pages. I was married on May 18, 2002. I have two
 <a href="../01/china_pictures.html">pictures</a> of my then fiancée, Cathy Ong, and me 
 on a trip we took to China in March 2001. On September 9, 2004, we returned 
 home from Russia with a newly adopted two year old boy, Nicholas Zhenya Simon. 
 Here's a <a href="../08/weblog2004/Zhenya.asp">picture</a> taken at the orphanage. 
 More details about the adoption and other personal aspects of my life are on my
 <a href="../03/update.html">Personal Update web page</a>.</p>
