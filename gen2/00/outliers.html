<p><strong>Outliers (January 28, 2000).</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/removing-outliers/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I have recently conducted a survey of attitudes 
 toward research from a professional group. There are some outliers (+/- 3SD) 
 that I would eliminate , but others conducting the research with me feel that 
 this might be a minority view, and should not be eliminate from the 
 dataset......any views or references that I should read to confirm my view, or 
 theirs?</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There are several things you can do here. The suggestion in Altman's book 
   (page 130) is to <strong>present an analysis with and without the outliers</strong>. 
   Think of it as a sensitivity analysis. This also allows the readers to make 
   up their own minds about which analysis to use.</p>
  <p>My suggestion is to investigate any outliers carefully and fix any obvious 
   typos. <strong>Never remove an outlier unless there is a good MEDICAL reason 
   to do so</strong>. Even then you might want to think twice.</p>
  <p><strong>Removing outliers is a deviation from the protocol and can lead to 
   serious biases</strong>. One possible exception is when you specify in your 
   original protocol how outliers will be handled (e.g., any lab result outside 
   three standard deviations will automatically be re-tested).</p>
  <p>The other thing to keep in mind is that <strong>sometimes the outliers are 
   more interesting than the rest of the data</strong>. Think about cancer 
   patients who survive much longer than their peers. Why would you want to 
   remove these &quot;outliers&quot;? These are the people you should be studying the 
   most.</p>
  <p>Also <strong>look for other factors that might explain the outliers</strong>. 
   Are all the outliers in upper management? Maybe you have a Dilbert factor 
   going on here. Look for any demographics that might be related to these 
   unusual data values. If oultliers are exclusively in a particular demographic 
   category (e.g., a specific age group), you have a great discovery that you 
   might have missed if you just mindlessly tossed out the data.</p>
  <p>There are a lot of good approaches to handling outliers, although your 
   original inclination to remove them without further effort is not the best 
   choice.</p>
