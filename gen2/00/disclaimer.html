<p><strong>Important disclaimer.</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/important-disclaimer/">new website</a>.</p>

<p>Although I work in a hospital, my profession is Statistics. I help the 
   doctors and nurses here plan research studies and make sense of the numbers 
   after the research is done. <strong>I am totally unqualified to provide 
   medical advice.</strong> If you have a question about Statistics, like &quot;When 
   would you use a median instead of a mean to summarize your data?&quot; then I can 
   provide an intelligent answer.</p>
<p>Some questions that might seem to you to be statistical in nature, such as, 
  &quot;What is the average age that infants can start taking solid foods?&quot; but 
   which I am still unqualified to answer. <strong>If you are unsure about 
   whether the question is medical or statistical, go ahead and ask</strong>. 
   The worst that will happen is that you will get a polite &quot;Sorry I don't know&quot; 
  response back.</p>
<p><strong>There are some good web sites that do offer medical advice from 
   professionals</strong>. I would encourage you to check these sites out in 
   addition to any advice you get from your family physician. <strong>If you 
   find any helpful advice at any of these other web sites, please let me know</strong>. 
   If none of these sites are helpful, please also let me know so I can stop 
   recommending them to people. </p>
