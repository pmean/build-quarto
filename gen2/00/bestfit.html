<p><strong>Best fitting curve</strong><b> (created 2000-01-26).</b></p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I have a graph of the trend for the mean frequency 
 of injuries among children from 1 to 11 years of age. The shape of the curve 
 suggests a nonlinear relationship between the age and the frequency of 
 injuries. Is there some software that would provide the best fitting curve for 
 this data from among a large family of nonlinear curves?</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>You might want to think twice about this endeavor. <strong>Finding the best 
   fitting curve from among a large family of curves has some of the same 
   pitfalls that stepwise regression has</strong>. Both approaches will tend to 
   overfit your data.</p>
  <p>In particular, <strong>any statistical tests would be invalid</strong> when 
   you select the curve solely on the basis of your data. The curve you get
   <strong>will not extrapolate well</strong> beyond the range of your data, and 
   it is likely to have <strong>poor agreement with any future data</strong> you 
   collect.</p>
  <p><strong>If you don't have any a priori or theoretical basis from which to 
   choose an equation, then a nonparametric approach like smoothing splines has 
   a lot of appeal</strong>. In particular, you might find a generalization of 
   Poisson regression, the generalized additive model, to work very well here. 
   Refer to Hastie and Tibshirani's book for more details. </p>
