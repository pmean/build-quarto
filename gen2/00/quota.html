<p><strong>Quota stratified random sampling.</strong></p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I'm doing my thesis right now and I have to use 
 quota stratified random sampling. I do not know the exact meaning of this term.</em></p>

  <p>When you say &quot;have to use&quot; does that imply that someone is making you use 
   this method? If so, shouldn't that person give you a book or reference that 
   might help?</p>
  <p>I am not familiar with the technical definition of quota stratified random 
   sampling, but generally quota sampling implies that you set a quota for 
   certain groups and you keep sampling until you meet the quota in each group. 
   Have you ever noticed those marketing folks who lurk in the shopping malls 
   with questionnaires on clipboards. Late in the afternoon they swoop down on 
   any males they can find because they've already met their quota for females.</p>

  <p>Everitt has a dictionary of statistics that defines quota sampling. You can 
   also find a description of quota sampling on pages 75-76 of Alreck and 
   Settle's book.</p>
