<p><strong>Splines (January 27, 2000).</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/what-is-spline-curve/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, Can you send me a basic definition of splines?</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A spline is a wiggly curve that changes its wiggles as it moves along to 
   try to touch each data point. It changes the wiggles in a graceful manner so 
   that it gives the appearance of a single curve.</p>
  <p>Statisticians also use smoothing splines which don't wiggle enough to go 
   through every single data point, but which still try to get reasonably close 
   to the data.</p>
  <p>Have you ever seen the french curve that is used in drafting? It is a way 
   to connect consecutive points in a way that looks smooth and natural. Splines 
   work in a similar fashion.</p>
  <p>I'm sure you were also interested in a technical definition. No? Well 
   you're going to get one anyway. A spline is a series of cubic polynomials. 
   Each cubic polynomial fits to a group of consecutive values. You also 
   constrain those cubic polynomials to be continuous and smooth (smooth means 
   it has a continuous first derivative). That's the mathematical definition.</p>
  <p>An alternative to the spline is a locally weighted average. For this 
   approach, at each data point, averaging or a simple regression model is fit 
   to data with high weight given to values that are close on the x-axis and low 
   weight given to values that are far away on the x-axis. When points are very 
   far away on the x-axis, they are given zero weight.</p>
  <p>Here's an example, looking at a lottery taken in the California recall 
   election that randomly assigned each letter of the alphabet. Notice a slight 
   tendency early in the process to select letters later in the alphabet. This 
   is a small sample and both splines and locally weighted averages tend to have 
   more uncertainty at the extremes, so it is possible that this is just an 
   artefact.</p>
