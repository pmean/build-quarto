<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I have to calculate a sample size for a binary 
 outcome variable. The research study is on breast feeding failures within 7 to 
 10 days of birth for mothers who intended to breast feed. The rate of failure 
 overall is expected to be about 12%. What sample size do I need? -- Baffled Bob</em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Baffled,</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Breast feeding failure is an example of a 
   binary outcome measure. There are only two possible values: the mother is 
   successfully breast feeding at 7 to 10 days, or the mother is not 
   successfully breast feeding at 7 to 10 days. Other examples of binary 
   outcomes would be:</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">the patient died (survived) within the 
    first year of study,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">the patient experienced (did not 
    experience) a specific side effect,</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">the patient had a positive (negative) 
    result on a diagnostic test.</font></li>
  </ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The sample size you need when you outcome is 
   binary is different than when your outcome is continuous. For a continuous 
   outcome, you need to specify the variability of your outcome measure and how 
   much of a change you would consider clinically relevant. For a binary 
   outcome, you still need to specify the clinically relevant change. But you 
   don't need a measure of variability. What you need instead is an estimate in 
   your control group of the probability for one level of your binary outcome. 
   You might also need to specify the distribution of your explanatory 
   (independent) variable.</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of the factors that might influence breast 
   feeding failure is whether the delivery was a vaginal birth or a C-section. 
   Let's assume that roughly 20% of the mothers in the sample had a C-section. 
   Expressing it in a different way, the ratio of vaginal births to C-sections 
   is 4 to 1.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's also assume that the rate of breast 
   feeding failure is 15% in the C-section group and 30% in the vaginal birth 
   group. You hypothesize that C-section babies fare better, because the mother 
   stays in the hospital longer. The extra time in the hospital allows greater 
   interaction with lactation consultants.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">You wish to use a two sided test at an alpha 
   level of 0.05. You also want the power to be at least 0.80. Under these 
   conditions, you would need a sample size of 435 mothers.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">[Show some of the formulas and calculations.]</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Baffled Bob wants to know how to calculate a sample size when his outcome 
   variable is binary (has only two possible values). Professor Mean explains 
   that you need to specify the probability of an outcome at two different 
   values of your predictor or independent variable.</p>
