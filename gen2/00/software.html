<p><strong>Software used to create these web pages.</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/web-page-software/">new website</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Here are a few details about the software I use to create these pages and 
   some tricks I have learned over time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Web authoring</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I use
   <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/home/office.aspx?assetid=FX01085802">
   Microsoft FrontPage</a>. I have several versions depending on whether I am at 
   work or at home. I try to avoid any fancy features in FrontPage, because I 
   don't want to use something proprietary that makes it difficult for someone 
   with an alternative web browser.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Math equations</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I use <a href="http://www.dessci.com/en/products/mathtype/">MathType</a> to 
   create most of the formulas on these web pages. I save the files directly in 
   GIF format and insert them into the page. The nice thing about MathType is 
   that you can re-open the GIF file and the codes that created that GIF file 
   reappear for further editing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Screen shots</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I've used almost a dozen different screen capture programs for these web 
   pages. The current program I am using, <a href="http://www.techsmith.com/">
   SnagIt</a>, is quite good.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Importing statistical graphs</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I use S-plus to draw a lot of the simple line graphs on my web pages.&nbsp; 
   Here's an example:</p>
  <p><img border="0" src="../03/images/mle1a.gif" width="352" height="272"></p>
  <p>It is very difficult to get the line graphs to look nice because when you 
   try to scale the graphs, the very fine detail is often lost. I have found 
   with repeated experience that it is best to produce a GIF file at the size 
   that I want for the web page.</p>
  <p><code>graphsheet(file=&quot;histogram##.gif&quot;,width=2.67,height=2,format=&quot;GIF&quot;)<br>
   # insert graphics code here.<br>
   dev.off()</code></p>
  <p>This code produces a graph with a width of 192 pixels and a height of 143 
   pixels.</p>
  <p>Watch for text labels and the axes, because these will often be too large 
   or too small. You can use the command</p>
  <p><code>par(cex=0.5)<br>
   </code><code>par(cex=2)</code></p>
  <p>to make the text half as big or twice as big. If I do not need axes and 
   labels, then the default graph will include a lot of white space. Te command</p>
  <p><code>par(mar=rep(0.1,4))</code></p>
  <p>will trim back almost all of the margins, including space that would have 
   been reserved for the axes and labels.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Bibliography</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I maintain a bibliography of research articles, books, and web sites using
   <a href="http://www.endnote.com/">EndNote</a>. This software has a lot of 
   nice options for formatting your bibliography the way you like best.</p>
  <p>I modified the fields for journal articles to include the PubMedID, and the 
   URLs for the abstract, full text, and/or pdf formats of the article if they 
   are available. I have a <a href="../details/Images/EndNoteReferenceTypes.pdf">PDF file 
   describing these modifications</a>.</p>
  <p>I have an output style, &quot;Formal web format with no abstract&quot; that inserts 
   html code automatically into any bibliography that I produce. This is what it 
   currently looks like, though I plan to add a few more features (such as 
   automatically incorporating a BookFinder4U link for any book that has an 
   ISBN). </p>
  <p><img border="0" src="../details/Images/software1.gif" width="429" height="360"></p>
  <p><br>
   When I include an article, here is what it looks like:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Missing the point (estimate)? Confidence intervals for the number 
     needed to treat.</b> Barrowman NJ. Cmaj 2002: 166(13); 1676-7.
     <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&db=PubMed&list_uids=12126323&dopt=Abstract">
     [Medline]</a> <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/content/full/166/13/1676">
     [Full text]</a> <a href="http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/166/13/1676.pdf">
     [PDF]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here is what a web site looks like:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><strong>
     <a href="http://www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/Extraforbando/NNTextra.pdf">
     Calculating and Using NNTs [pdf]</a></strong>. Bandolier. Accessed on 
     2003-06-12. www.jr2.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/Extraforbando/NNTextra.pdf</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Here is what a book looks like:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><b>Evidence-based Medicine How to Practice and Teach EBM.</b> Sackett DL, 
     MD, Richardson SW, Rosenberg W, Haynes BR (1998) Edinburgh: Churchill 
     Livingstone. ISBN: 0443056862. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These &quot;Formal web format with no abstract&quot; style is stored with the rest of 
   the EndNote program under the Styles folder.</p>
  <p>EndNotes is a complex program, and one of the tricks I learned is how to 
   incorporate a link only when I have certain information. There are &quot;Forced 
   Separations&quot; symbols, denoted by the vertical bar (|) and &quot;Link Adjacent 
   Text&quot; symbols, denoted by a centered dot (<font face="Times New Roman">a 
   symbol not easily displayed on this web page</font>) that are a bit tricky to 
   learn how to use. When you learn out how they work, you can safely 
   distinguish between books with and without an ISBN code.</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Title.&lt;/b&gt; Author (Year) City: Publisher. 
   &lt;a&nbsp;<br>
   href=http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/ISBN.html&gt;<br>
   [BookFinder4U&nbsp;Link]&lt;/a&gt;|&lt;/p&gt;</code></font></p>
  <p>The trick is to use the Link Adjacent Text symbol between the
   <font color="#FF0000"><code>&lt;a</code></font> and the <code>
   <font color="#FF0000">href=</code></font>, and between the <code>
   <font color="#FF0000">[BookFinder4U</code></font> and the <code>
   <font color="#FF0000">Link]</code></font>. You also need a forced separation 
   between the <code><font color="#FF0000">&lt;/a&gt;</code></font> and the
   <font color="#FF0000"><code>&lt;/p&gt;</code></font>. The Link Adjacent text 
   insures that the elements always appear together or not at all, depending on 
   whether the ISBN is known. Text following the Forced Separation appears no 
   matter what happens with regard to the ISBN. We always want to include the
   <font color="#FF0000"><code>&lt;/p&gt;</code></font> and while inserting a blank 
   would work, that leaves an unnecessary blank dangling right before the end of 
   the paragraph.</p>
  <p>The same tricks allow EndNotes to insert a link to the Abstract (but only 
   when the abstract is available on the web), the Full Text (but only when the 
   full text is available on the web), and so forth. If I have an Accession 
   Number for a journal article, I can even link to the Medline citation of this 
   article through the following code:</p>
  <p><font color="#FF0000"><code>&lt;a&nbsp;href=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi<br>
   ?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=Accession Number&amp;<br>
   dopt=Abstract&gt;[Medline]&lt;/a&gt;</code></font></p>
  <p>As in the previous example, you need a Link Adjacent Text symbol between 
   the <font color="#FF0000"><code>&lt;a</code></font> and the
   <font color="#FF0000"><code>href=</code></font>. </p>

<p><b>Reprint requests</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I have not yet included any comic strips, such as The Far Side or Dilbert, 
   in my web pages, but I might start sometime soon.</p>
  <p>Reprint requests for Dilbert are sent to
   <a href="mailto:reprints@unitedmedia.com">reprints@unitedmedia.com</a>, and 
   details about reprints appear in the United Media FAQ at</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
     <a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/info/faq_and_contacts.html">
     www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/info/faq_and_contacts.html</a>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Another nice selection of comics is available at Cartoonbank:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><a href="http://www.cartoonbank.com/">www.cartoonbank.com/</a> </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>which has many of the cartoons that originally appeared in The New Yorker.</p>
  <p>I also have an image from the CNN web site that I am asking for permission 
   to use. The email address for this request went to cnn.viewersource@turner.com.</p>
