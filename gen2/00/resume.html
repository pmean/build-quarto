   Business Statistic courses, I have run these programs as part of my lectures 
   on the Central Limit Theorem, on the effect of sample size on sampling error, 
   and on the meaning of confidence in a 95% confidence interval. In addition, I 
   have used these programs in a presentation, &quot;Simulating Random Sampling&quot; (see

   <a href="OBJECTIVE:" To compare nasogastric tube and bottle supplementation as two means of transitioning preterm infants to breastfeeding within an established breastfeeding support program. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized controlled trial; mothers and health care providers, who were not blinded. SETTING: Metropolitan private regional perinatal center; 40-bed intensive-care nursery. PARTICIPANTS: Eighty-four preterm breastfed infants whose birth weight was 1,000-2,500 g. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of exclusive and partial breastfeeding at discharge from the intensive-care nursery, and at 3 days, 3 months, and 6 months after discharge. RESULTS: Compared with infants receiving bottle supplements, infants receiving nasogastric tube supplements were more likely to be breastfeeding at discharge and at 3 days, 3 months and 6 months, after adjusting for confounding variables. Odds ratios (confidence intervals="95%)" showed that the group receiving nasogastric supplements was 4.5 times (1.4 to 15) more likely to be breastfed at discharge and 9.4 times more likely to be fully breastfed (3.1 to 28.4). There were significantly fewer apnea and bradycardia episodes in the group receiving nasogastric supplements, although they had more episodes that required stimulation for resolution. Groups were not different with respect to length of hospitalization and infant weight at discharge. CONCLUSIONS: Using nasogastric tube supplementation during transition to oral feedings increases the likelihood of breastfeeding at discharge, 3 days, 3 months, and 6 months. This intervention requires a program with skilled personnel and an environment that allows the mother and infant to be in close physical proximity. Further study should investigate differences in the effects on maternal confidence, imprinting, and suck mechanism when preterm infants are bottle fed and breastfed.>

<p><b>Grants<a name="Grants"></a></b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><b>Pediatric Pharmacology Research Unit</b> (HD31313-09. Principal 
   Investigator: Greg Kearns). Funded by NIH/NICHD from 01/01/1994 through 
   12/31/2003. Total direct costs of $361,932 in 2002. I am funded at 3% effort 
   on this grant.</p>
  <p>The major goal of this project is to conduct basic and translational 
   research focusing on regulatory events in pharmacogenetics, the ontogeny of 
   important drug metabolizing enzymes, and pharmacodynamics that will advance 
   our understanding of age-related differences in drug disposition and action.
  </p>
  <p><b>Sex, SLE, and Signal Transduction </b>(AR50878-01. Principal 
   Investigator: Jill Jacobson). Funded by NIH/NIAID from 12/01/01 through 
   11/30/06. Total direct costs of $250,000 in 2002. I am funded at 5% effort on 
   this grant.</p>
  <p>The major goal of this project is to demonstrate that the increase in 
   immune responsiveness to gonadotropin-releasing hormone in female mice plays 
   a pivotal role in increased incidence of autoimmune disease.</p>
