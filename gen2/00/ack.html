<p><strong>Acknowledgements (January 28, 2000)</strong>. </p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/acknowledge-help/">new website</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>These web pages have several Sherlock Holmes quotes. These quotes can be 
   found in the marvelous book <em>Statistically Speaking. A Dictionary of 
   Quotations</em>, by C.C. Gaither and A.E. Cavazos-Gaither, Institute of 
   Physics Publishing, Bristol, UK (1996).</p>
  <p>Personal thanks to the many people who have sent comments and corrections. 
   I should especially single out Dicon Montford who caught many spelling and 
   grammar errors.</p>
