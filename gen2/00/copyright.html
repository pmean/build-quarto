<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/copyright/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Copyright notice.</strong></p>
 
       <p>When these pages were originally developed, the lawyers suggested that 
       I copyright these pages. In January of 2008 I asked for and got 
       permission to place these pages under an open access license. What this 
       means is that you can use these pages however you like, including a 
       derivative work as long as you acknowledge the original source. A link 
       back to the original page or a listing of the URL of the page would be 
       sufficient acknowledgement.</p>
       <p>People will sometimes ask for permission to link to my pages. That has 
       never been an issue. You can link to my site without any restrictions. It would be nice if you could let me 
       know you are linking to my page. Also it would be nice if you could send me the URL of the 
       page that includes the link to my site. That way, I can show my boss how much interest my web 
       pages are attracting.</p>
