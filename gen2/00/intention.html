<p><strong>Intention to treat (created 2000-01-27).</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/what-is-itt/">new website</a>.</p>

  <p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, I'm confused by medical journal articles 
 that talk about the use of &quot;Intention to Treat&quot; analysis. What does this term mean?</font></em></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>An intention to treat analysis specifies how to 
    handle noncompliant patients in a randomized control trial</strong>. This analysis requires 
    that patients be analyzed in the groups they were randomized into, regardless of whether they 
    complied with the treatment they were given.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">At first, this seems counter-intuitive. If you are trying to 
    see how effective a new drug might be, why would you include patients who refused to take the 
    drug? <strong>An analysis that only includes compliant patients has two drawbacks</strong>.</font></p>
  <ol>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Groups defined by compliance are no longer randomized and 
      are thus subject to biases.</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Groups defined by compliance may not represent the 
      practical impact of the treatment.</font></li>
  </ol>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The intention to treat analysis has some controversy, 
    however. When you are examining a randomized control trial, ask yourself whether it is 
    logical to include noncompliant patients.</font></p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Intention to treat preserves randomization</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong>The validity of a randomized control trial depends greatly on the process of 
       randomization</strong>. Randomization insures that both measurable and unmeasurable factors 
       will balance out on average. If a factor other than the treatment itself could possibly 
       influence an outcome measure in your study, then randomization insures that patients with 
       this factor are equally likely to receive either the treatment or the placebo. This prevents 
       many types of bias that can occur in a non-randomized trial.</p>
  <p><strong>An analysis that excludes noncompliant patients is no longer randomized and might 
       cause serious bias</strong>. Consider a hypothetical example where you are comparing a 
       surgical treatment to a non-surgical control. Some patients might die prior to surgery. This 
       is an extreme example of noncompliance. If we exclude these patients from the analysis, we 
       are eliminating rapidly dying patients from the surgery group, but not from the control 
       group.</p>
  <p><strong>Intention to treat analysis is more realistic</strong></p>
  <p>There are many factors that influence whether a patient complies or not with a treatment. 
       Some of the factors that influence compliance might also influence the outcome measure. In 
       particular, noncompliant patients tend to have worse outcomes than compliant patients, even 
       in a placebo group. Perhaps patients who forget to follow a prescribed treatment will also 
       forget to do other things important for their health. <strong>Thus an analysis that excludes 
       non-compliant patients may produce a study population that is healthier than the patients 
       that you see</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Intention to treat analysis is especially important for medications that are 
       difficult to tolerate</strong>. If you exclude noncompliant patients, you are ignoring the 
       influence of poor tolerability on the efficacy of a treatment.</p>
  <p><strong>Dropouts in an intention to treat analysis</strong></p>
  <p>Sometimes patients who don't comply with a prescribed treatment will also not comply with 
       the measurement of the outcome. For example, someone who stops taking a drug may also not 
       show up for evaluation either. These people might more properly be labeled as dropouts rather 
       than noncompliant patients. <strong>Dropouts may make it impossible to perform an intention 
       to treat analysis, even if you wanted to</strong>.</p>
  <p>There are a few situations where we can still handle this type of noncompliance. For 
       example, if you are studying smoking cessation, you might conservatively label as a smoker 
       anyone who stops participating in the smoking cessation program. In a study of weight loss, 
       you might assume that a dropout has zero weight loss. <strong>Even so, you should always try 
       to design a study that avoids or minimizes the possibility of dropouts</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Excluding noncompliant patients prior to randomization</strong></p>
  <p>Some studies evaluate follow patients for a period of time before they are randomized into 
       treatment groups. These studies might allow you to exclude noncompliant patients prior to 
       randomization. If it makes sense to exclude noncompliant patients, this approach allows you 
       to preserve randomization. Be careful, though. <strong>Excluding noncompliant patients prior 
       to randomization could make your research results more difficult to generalize to the real 
       world</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Example</font></strong></p>
  <p>A good example of the effect of compliance on an intervention is the MRFIT (Multiple Risk 
       Factor Intervention Trial) study. This study looked at men who were at high risk of heart 
       attacks. Half of the men were randomized into a Special Intervention (SI) group that received 
       advice about dietary changes and were encouraged to quit smoking if they were current 
       smokers. The other half recieved the usual care (UC) from their physicians.</p>
  <p>The focus of the study was on a comprehensive intervention with smoking cessation as just 
       one component. So please consider that the following discussion which focuses on the smoking 
       aspects alone is an oversimplification of this study.</p>
  <p>The MRFIT study had two separate compliance issues. First, some of the SI patients 
       continued to smoke in spite of efforts to get them to quit. Second, some of the UC patients 
       quit even thoug they didn't get any special encouragement. The researchers were glad that 
       some of the UC patients quit, I'm sure, and were not surprised that some of the SI patients 
       continued to smoke. But the net effect of this was to dilute the effect of smoking cessation.</p>
  <p>When you looked at those who smoked at baseline, more of them died than non smokers. And 
       when you looked at those who quit during the study regardless of which group they were in, 
       fewer of them died. But groups defined by their baseline smoking or by their change in 
       smoking status during the study were not randomized groups.</p>
  <p>An intention to treat analysis would look at the two randomized groups and would ignore 
       the fact that some of the intervention group. Although there is plenty of data to suggest 
       that <strong>smoking cessation</strong> reduces your risk of death, the MRFIT trials tell us 
       is that <strong>this particular smoking cessation program</strong> doesn't. In other words, 
       getting someone to quit is effective; telling someone to quit smoking is ineffective.</p>
  <p>There are some randomized trials that did show a difference in mortality, possibly because 
       the patients were better at complying, possibly because of differences in the subject pool. 
       And the issues are more complex than I can explain well in a simple message like this. 
       Besides ignoring the dietary portion of the intervention, it's worth noting that the were 
       multiple outcomes in the MRFIT study and they were assessed at multiple time points. Also 
       there were strong consistencies in the direction of the effects seen in the MRFIT trials and 
       some attempts to adjust for compliance issues seemed to illustrate that the intervention 
       would have been effective if it had convinced more people to quit smoking.</p>
  <p>Still, the general explanation is that for this study, the ITT analysis, which ignores 
       compliance, is a measure of the effectiveness of the smoking cessation program. An analysis 
       that factored in compliance would no longer be a randomized comparison, but it would be a 
       better measure of the effectiveness of smoking cessation.</p>
  <p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Summary</font></strong></p>
  <p>Inquisitive Irene wants to know <strong>what the phrase &quot;Intention to Treat&quot; means</strong> 
    in all the journal articles she is reading. <strong>Intention to Treat is a method that 
       includes noncompliant patients in the groups to which they were originally randomized into</strong>. 
       There are two reasons why you might use this approach. First, intention to treat <strong>
       preserves the effects of randomization</strong>. Second, intention to treat often <strong>
       provides an assessment of the practical impact of a treatment</strong>. There are some 
       examples, however, where <strong>intention to treat may answer a different question than the 
       one you are interested in</strong>.</p>
