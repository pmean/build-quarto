<p><strong>Physician Performance Data (January 27, 2000).</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/physician-performance-data/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, Producing statistics of physician performance or 
 group performance or whatever seems to be one of the great growth industries in 
 medicine. Graphs of performance in just about anything seem to be produced - 
 usually with something that looks at first glance like a normal distribution 
 (and almost never with any statistical addenda). But I would like to know 
 whether we can use them sensibly as anything other than pictures. In particular 
 when I am one of the subjects of the analysis how do I interpret my own 
 performance?</em></p>
<p>Do like everyone else does. When a graph or table shows that you are the 
   best physician in your group, praise the method as innovative and cutting 
   edge. When it shows that you are the worst physician, pull out your stock 
   complaint about &quot;lies, damned lies, and statistics&quot;.</p>
<p>Seriously, this is a difficult area. The bad news is that measures of 
   performance will typically be subject to strenuous disputes, even when they 
   are based on solid statistical methods. But the worse news is that the 
   statistical methods frequently used are, at best, simplistic. It would be 
   impossible to do justice to the complexities of physician performance in this 
   brief web page, but I can make some general comments about the <strong>
   limitations of statistics</strong>. I also want to <strong>encourage the use 
   of control charts</strong> as a good way to view this type of data.</p>
<p><strong>Statistics are great at characterizing the behavior of groups, but 
   they don't do as well when they try to characterize the behavior of 
   individuals</strong>. With care, you can use Statistics to characterize 
   individuals, but you want to avoid blindly using the Statistical methods that 
   have been developed for clinical trials. Just as a simple example, you should 
   note that characterizing individual behavior is not an activity that fits in 
   well with the traditional hypothesis driven research. Do you set up a 
   separate hypothesis for each doctor?</p>
<p>There is an additional problem. <b>Most rating systems fail to properly 
   adjust for all sources of uncertainty</b>. Some hospitals, for example, have 
   a smaller case load and these estimates are more unstable. So an outlier for 
   a small hospital may simply be normal variation.</p>
<p><b>A promising approach is the use of random effects models, empirical 
   bayes approaches, and shrinkage estimates</b> (these are all interrelated). 
   These models, unfortunately, are very complex, and require extensive 
   consultation with a professional statistician.</p>
<p>There's a more fundamental philosophical issue. We have a tendency, 
   especially in the United States, to want to rank and rate everything in 
   sight. We have the top 100 movies of the past century, and the Places Rated 
   Almanac of the best places to live. Many companies are returning to employee 
   evaluation systems that enforce a quota of at least x percent unsatisfactory 
   ratings. <b>These efforts to rank and rate seem innocuous enough on the 
   outside, but do they really serve a useful purpose?</b> What are the hidden 
   costs? It may be worthwhile to read some of the thoughts of W. Edwards 
   Deming, Alfie Kohn, and Peter Scholtes. After looking at their perspective, 
   you may decide that your efforts to identify good and bad PCP's may not be 
   appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>It is tricky to decipher when a deviation is part of the random 
   fluctuations that are an inherent part of the medical system and when a 
   deviation is an indication of a special cause that we might want to 
   investigate and learn from</strong>. We all have a tendency to overestimate 
   and overreact to small deviations that may be nothing more than normal 
   variation.</p>
<p><strong>When we see deviations, we tend to attribute them too often to the 
   individual and tend to ignore the environment that the individual works in</strong>. 
   If there are unacceptably large variations in performance, your first thought 
   ought to be &quot;how do I change the environment to reduce this variation&quot; but 
   it's human nature instead to say, &quot;who should I retrain or reprimand&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Further reading</strong></p>
<p>Another good book to look at is <strong><em>Understanding Variation</em></strong> 
  by Donald Wheeler. This is a delightful and very easy to read book that 
  explains many of the <strong>problems that businesses have with handling 
      variation in their production lines</strong>. Again, you need to extrapolate; 
    a doctor's office is not a production line. If you think about some of the 
    ways that physician performance data has been abused and misused, then you 
    will see that these same types of abuses from a business context in Wheeler's 
   book.</p>

<p><strong>Control charts</strong></p>
<p>After you've read Walton and/or Wheeler, you may come to the conclusion 
   that the statistical control chart, a tool widely used in industry, has 
   similar applicability in health care. I would encourage you to apply control 
   chart methods to physician performance data as well as a lot of other data 
   that is not usually examined carefully in the health care context.</p>
<p>I'm working with some nurses at Children's Mercy Hospital to <strong>use 
   control charts to track medication errors, patient complaints, employee 
   accidents, unplanned sick leave, employee turnover, and additional measures 
   of organizational safety and effectiveness</strong>. It has a lot of 
   potential, in my opinion, to handle both this type of data as well as the 
   type of data you are referring to.</p>
<p>I need to add a disclaimer that health care is different from most other 
   businesses. That doesn't mean that health care can't use control charts, but 
   it does mean that we can't blindly apply a process developed for industries 
   that produce fast cars and fast food. So some type of adaptation will be 
   necessary.</p>
