<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, I'm going on a job 
 interview and I know one of the questions they will ask me is about interim 
 analysis. What should I tell them? -- Harried Howard</font></em></p>
 
<p>Dear Harried, Tell them that you rely on Professor Mean for all your statistical advice. 
That will clinch the job for you. What? They've never heard of Professor Mean? Are you sure you really want 
to work there?</p>
<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>

  <p>Interim analysis is <strong>analysis of the data at one or more time points 
   prior to the official close of the study</strong> with the intention of 
   possibly terminating the study early. There are several things to keep in 
   mind with an interim analysis.</p>

  <ol>
    <li>You might want to continue a trial, even after you have accumulated 
    substantial evidence that the new therapy is superior, because you need the 
    extra data to accurately characterize side effects.</li>
    <li>The details of the interim analysis should always be specified prior to 
    data collection.</li>
    <li>The level of evidence that you need to stop a study early is higher than 
    what is needed at the end of the study.</li>
  </ol>

<p><strong>More details</strong></p>

  <p>In a study where you expect the new therapy to be better than placebo, for 
   example, you might want to <strong>stop the study as soon as you have enough 
   evidence that the new therapy is better</strong>. There are <strong>ethical 
   reasons</strong> (you want to minimize the number of subjects getting the 
   placebo) and <strong>economic reasons</strong> (you don't to spend extra 
   money after enough evidence has been accumulated).</p>
  <p>Stopping because the new therapy is better is the most common reason for 
   interim analysis, though there are others. Sometimes you might want to end a 
   study early <strong>if a substantial number of patients experience serious 
   side effects</strong>. Other times, you may want to end a study early because 
   the evidence clearly shows that <strong>the results at the end of the trial 
   are likely to be negative</strong>. This approach is sometimes called 
   futility analysis.</p>
  <p>If you want to run one or more interim analyses, you need to realize that
   <strong>there is no free lunch</strong>. If you apply the traditional test at 
   both the middle and the end of the study, you increase the chance of Type I 
   error (a false positive finding). You can (and should) make adjustments to 
   prevent this, but then you end up requiring a greater amount of evidence, 
   both at the middle and at the end of the study.</p>
  <p>The two classic approaches to interim analysis are the <strong>Pocock
   </strong>method and the <strong>O'Brien-Fleming</strong> method. <strong>Both 
   approaches require equally spaced intervals</strong>. This means that if two 
   interim and one final analyses are planned, then the first interim analysis 
   occurs after exactly one third of the data has been collected and the second 
   interim analysis occurs after exactly two thirds of the data have been 
   collected. Recently, a more flexible approach, the alpha spending function, 
   has been developed for unequally spaced intervals.</p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Example</font></strong></p>

  <p><font face="Times New Roman">A standard study would wait until all the data 
   was collected and would declare the new therapy to be effective if the 
   p-value were less than .05. Let's assume that we want <strong>two interim and 
   one final analysis</strong>.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <strong>Pocock</strong> procedure uses the
   <strong>same cut-off</strong> for both the interim and final analyses. With 
   two interim and one final analysis, we would declare the new therapy to be 
   effective <strong>if the p-value is less than 0.022</strong> at any of the 
   analysis times.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">The <strong>O'Brien-Fleming</strong> method 
   uses a <strong>very strict cut-off at first</strong>, then <strong>relaxes 
   this cut-off over time</strong>. At the first interim analysis, you would 
   conclude that the new therapy is effective <strong>if the p-value is less 
   than 0.005</strong>. At the second interim analysis, you would <strong>
   compare the p-value to 0.014</strong>. At the end of the study, you would
   <strong>compare the p-value to 0.045</strong>.</font></p>
  <p>Both approaches pay a penalty at the final analysis, but notice that
   <strong>the O'Brien-Fleming method, which has stricter standards earlier, has 
   much less of a penalty at the planned conclusion of the study</strong>.</p>

<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Summary</font></strong></p>

  <p>Harried Howard wants to make an impression during his job interview by 
   giving <strong>a simple explanation of what interim analysis (or a group 
   sequential trial) is</strong>. Professor Mean explains the interim analysis 
   is a <strong>statistical analysis at one or more time points prior to the 
   official end of the study with the intention of ending the study early if 
   there is sufficient evidence of efficacy</strong>. He explains that you have 
   to pay a price with an interim analysis, by living with a smaller alpha level 
   at the end of your study. He then characterizes two simple approaches to 
   interim analysis by Pocock and O'Brien-Fleming.</p>
