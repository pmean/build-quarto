  <blockquote>
       <p>When I ask most people to remember their high school algebra class, I get a mixture of 
       reactions. Most recoil in horror. About one in every four people say they liked that class. 
       Personally, I thought that algebra, and all the other math classes I took were great because 
       they didn't require writing a term paper.</p>
       <p>One formula in algebra that most people can recall is the formula for a straight line. 
       Actually, there are several different formulas, but the one that most people cite is</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p>Y = m X + b</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>where <b>m</b> represents the slope, and <b>b</b> represents the y-intercept (we'll call it just the 
       intercept here). They can also sometimes remember the formula for the slope:</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p>m =<font face="Times New Roman"> &#916;y / &#916;x</font></p>
       </blockquote>
       <p><font face="Times New Roman">In English, we would say that this is the change in 
       <b>y</b> divided 
       by the change in <b>x.</b></font></p>
       <p><font face="Times New Roman">In linear regression, we use a straight 
       linear to estimate a trend in data. We can't always draw a straight line 
       that passes through every data point, but we can find a line that &quot;comes 
       close&quot; to most of the data. This line is an estimate, and we interpret 
       the slope and the intercept of this line as follows:</font></p>

            <tr>
                 <td width="559"><font face="Times New Roman">The <b>slope</b> represents the <b>
                  estimated average change in Y when X increases by one unit.</b></font><p>
                  <font face="Times New Roman">The <b>intercept</b> represents <b>the estimated 
                  average value of Y when X equals zero.</b> </font>
            </tr>
       </table>
       <p><font face="Times New Roman">Be cautious with your interpretation of the intercept. 
       Sometimes the value X=0 is impossible, implausible, or represents a dangerous extrapolation 
       outside the range of the data.</font></p>
       <p><font face="Times New Roman">The graph shown below represents the relationship between 
       mother's age and the duration of breast feeding in a research study on breast feeding in 
       pre-term infants.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/lin_coef1.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>The regression coefficients are shown below. The intercept, 6, is represented the 
       estimated average duration of breast feeding for a mother that is zero years old. This is an 
       impossible value, so the interpretation is not useful. What is useful, is the interpretation 
       of the slope, approximately 0.4. The estimated average duration of breast feeding increases 
       by 0.4 weeks for every extra year in the mother's age.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/lin_coef4.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p><font face="Times New Roman">When X is categorical, the interpretation changes somewhat. 
       Let's look at the simplest situation, a binary variable. A binary variable can have only two 
       possible categories. Some examples are live/dead, treatment/control, diseased/healthy, 
       male/female. We need to assign number codes to the categories. Most people assign the codes 1 
       and 2, but it is actually better to assign the codes 0 and 1.</font></p>
       <p><font face="Times New Roman">In a study of breast feeding, we have a treatment group and a 
       control group. Let us label the treatment group as 1 and the control group as 0. The outcome 
       variable is the age when breast feeding stopped.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/lin_coef2.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>The control group had a mean duration of breast feeding just a bit larger than 13. The 
       mean for the treatment group is just a bit larger than 20. Notice that the regression line 
       shown above connects the two means.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/lin_coef5.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>In this situation, the intercept, 13, represents the average duration for the control 
       group. The slope is 7, which is the change in the average duration when we move from the 
       control group to the treatment group.</p>
       <p>We could have just as easily labeled the treatment group as 0 and the 
       control group as 1. If we did that, we would get a graph that looks like 
       the following:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/lin_coef3.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Here, the intercept, 20, represents the mean of the treatment group. The slope, -7, 
       represents the change in average duration as we move from the treatment group to the control 
       group. It is actually this reverse coding that SPSS chooses as a default.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/lin_coef6.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Neither coding is correct or incorrect. Just make sure that you understand the difference. 
       If you get a slope that is in the opposite direction of what you expected, perhaps it is 
       because your software is using a different coding than what you expected.</p>
       <table border="1" cellpadding="20" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="420" id="AutoNumber1" bgcolor="#C0C0C0">
            <tr>
                 <td width="558"><font face="Times New Roman">When we represent a binary variable 
                  using 0-1 coding, the <b>slope</b> represents the <b>estimated average change in Y 
                  when you switch from one group to the other.</b></font><p>
                  <font face="Times New Roman">The <b>intercept</b> represents <b>the estimated 
                  average value of Y for the group coded as zero.</b> </font>
            </tr>
       </table>
       <p>The interpretation of the regression coefficient for a categorical variable with more than 
       two values is a bit trickier, and we will discuss it in a separate handout.</p>

  <p><b>Florida election results example</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>There has been much discussion of the unusual ballot format in Palm Beach County, Florida 
       and how it may have led several thousand voters to cast their ballots for Buchanan rather 
       than Gore. Greg Adams and Chris Fastnow (http://madison.hss.cmu.edu/) have performed a 
       regression analysis of the county by county returns in Florida. A portion of their analyses 
       is recomputed below using SPSS. My model is slightly different than the model of Adams and 
       Fastnow, but it reaches the same general conclusion: the vote for Buchanan in Palm Beach 
       County, Florida is a couple of thousand votes higher than you would expect, if it behaved 
       similar to other Florida Counties.</p>
       <p>The story behind the Palm Beach County vote is quite controversial. I discuss it, not to 
       revive the controversy, but to illustrate some concepts in linear regression. Some background 
       information is at:</p>

       <p>The ballot in Palm Beach county was (according to some people) confusing, because it used 
       a staggered two page format. The layout would lead some people who thought they were voting 
       for Al Gore to instead cast a ballot for Patrick Buchanan instead. Exactly how confusing the 
       ballot was and is still open to debate. Several statisticians offered analyses that tried to 
       estimate how many votes for Buchanan might actually be votes for Gore. These analyses are 
       far more detailed than what I present here. My analysis is more useful for helping you to 
       understand concepts in regression than for resolving this voting controversy.&nbsp; </p>

  <blockquote>
       <p>The scatter plot shown above shows the number of votes for George Bush in each Florida 
       County versus the number of votes for Patrick Buchanan in the same county.</p>
       <p>The regression equation is:</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p>Votes (Buchanan) = 45.3 +0.0049 * Votes (Bush)</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>Notice that 0.0049 is roughly 1/500. How do we interpret these numbers? The intercept is 
       45, which means that the estimated average number of votes for Buchanan would be 45 in a 
       county with zero votes for Bush. This is an extrapolation, as every single county in Florida 
       had thousands of votes for Bush. The slope is 1/200, which means that the estimated average 
       number of votes for Buchanan increases by 1/200 for each additional vote for Bush. In other 
       words, each additional 200 votes for Bush is associated with an increase of 1 vote for 
       Buchanan.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
       <p>We can compute a predicted number of votes for Buchanan for each county by using the 
       above equation. Palm Beach County had 152,846 votes for Bush. So the regression model would 
       predict that Buchanan should get:</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p>45 + 0.0049 * 152,846 =&nbsp; 797.</p>
       </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Thus, if the relationship observed across the entire state held exactly in Palm Beach 
       County, then we would estimate the vote count for Buchanan to be 797.</p>
       <p>There were actually 3,407 votes recorded for Buchanan, which is quite a discrepancy from 
       what we predicted. The residual, the difference between what we observed and what would be 
       predicted by the regression model is:</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p>3,407 - 797 = 2,610.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p>One possible interpretation is that this discrepancy represents an estimate of the number 
       of people who voted incorrectly for Buchanan. Such an interpretation would have to consider 
       other possibilities, though. Is there something unique about Palm Beach County that would 
       cause that county to vote in disproportionate numbers for Buchanan? Buchanan does indeed 
       have some relatives in the area, and although they do not number in the thousands, perhaps 
       they exerted some influence on their community.</p>
       <p>Other information might tend to corroborate that a large number of votes were cast 
       erroneously for Buchanan. Some of the highest vote counts for Buchanan were in precincts 
       that were most heavily Democratic. There were also a large number of complaints received by 
       the election board prior to anyone knowing how close the vote count in Florida would be.</p>
       <p>There are other models that have been considered for the Palm Beach County vote, and most 
       of them show a similar size discrepancy between the observed vote and the vote that would be 
       predicted the regression model. It would set a dangerous precedent, of course, to use a 
       statistical model to adjust vote counts, so this example is more for understanding what might 
       have gone wrong and the magnitude of the error made.</p>
