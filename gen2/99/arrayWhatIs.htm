<p><strong>What is a microarray? (no date)</strong> [incomplete]</p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/what-is-micro-array/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><b>What is a microarray?</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>A microarray is a tool for measuring the amount of messenger RNA (mRNA) 
  that is circulating in a cell. It is the mRNA that transfers information from 
  the genes from DNA inside the nucleus of a cell to create various proteins. 
  Even though they have the exact same DNA, different cells have different 
  amounts of various mRNA because they need to produce different proteins. For 
  example, only certain cells in the pancreas produce insulin even though the 
  DNA code for producing insulin exists inside all cells.</p>
  <p>Genes that produce a lot of mRNA are said to be upregulated and genes that 
   produce little or no mRNA are said to be downregulated.</p>
  <p>Microarrays simultaneously measure the amount of circulating mRNA for 
   hundreds or even thousands of different mRNAs. They have applications in many 
   different research areas.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Because the types and amounts of circulating mRNA effectively 
    distinguish one type of cell from another, microarrays can help us better 
    understand the factors that differentiate cells.</li>
    <li>Stems cells are undifferentiated cells that have the potential to 
    transform into many different types of cells. Microarrays can help us 
    understand how the transformation from a stem cell to a differentiated cell 
    occurs.</li>
    <li>Within a cell, the types and amounts of mRNA vary during different 
    stages of a cells life, so microarrays can help us understand what proteins 
    are needed during these different stages.</li>
    <li>Certain diseases occur because of the failure of cells to produce the 
    proteins that they are expected to produce, so microarrays can help us 
    understand these diseases better and identify targets for new therapies.</li>
    <li>Other diseases like cancer occur when a group of cells grows out of 
    control. Microarrays can help us better understand what triggers this rapid 
    uncontrolled growth. </li>

<p><b>How does a microarray work?</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Circulating mRNA from a clump of cells is converted to the complementary 
   DNA strands (cDNA). The cDNA is amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
   and a molecular tag that glows is attached to each piece of cDNA. This 
   mixture is then washed over a slide that has spots where the cDNA can bind. 
   Any loose or unbound cDNA is then washed away. The amount of fluorescence at 
   a particular spot on the microarray gives you an indication as to how much 
   mRNA of a particular type was in the original sample. </p>

<p><b>The Affy chip</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Affymetrix produces a different type of microarray that uses 
   photolithography to build the microarray, a process similar to the approach 
   used to create semiconductor chips.&nbsp; The Affy chips as they are often 
   called, place thousands or tens of thousands of genes on a slide that can fit 
   in the palm of your hand. Unlike spotted arrays, that places spots of the 
   full sequence of the gene (or Expressed Sequence Tag) on a slide, the Affy 
   chip selects 20 probes for each gene, each of which has a length of 25 base 
   pairs. Next to each of these probes is another probe that represents the same 
   25 base pair sequence except that the middle base is changed. The 20 probes 
   are called PM (Perfect Match) probes and the probes with the changed middle 
   base are called MM (MisMatch) probes. The MM probes are an attempt to measure 
   and control for cross-hybridization, the tendency for genes that are similar, 
   but not identical to a particular gene sequence to bind weakly to these 
   sites.</p>
