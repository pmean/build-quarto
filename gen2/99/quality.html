<p><b>Steps for establishing a quality control program (March 12, 2004)</b></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/steps-in-quality-control/">new website</a>.</p>

  <blockquote>
       <p>So you've decided to implement a quality control program in your laboratory. What will it 
       take to make that program successful? There are three steps, and you must follow these steps 
       in order.</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        Step 1. Establish management support.<li>
        Step 2. Measure your process.<li>
        Step 3. Experiment.</ul>
       <p>Every work situation is different, of course, but these steps are a useful guideline. 
       Start first with management support.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Step 1. Establish management support.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>If you are already the boss, congratulations. <b>A quality control program is easiest to 
       implement from the top down.</b> Make sure you understand the commitment of time and money 
       that is involved. Every workplace is different, but think about allocating 10% of your time 
       and 10% of the time of all your employees to quality control. <b>Don't pretend that you can 
       implement a serious quality control program in the margins of free time.</b> You have to 
       re-allocate time that normally would be used &quot;getting the real work done.&quot;</p>
       <p>If you are not the boss, you have to convince someone else that your company has to make a
       <b>substantial re-investment of resources</b>. That's not an easy thing to do, but you do 
       need support from your boss. Otherwise, you'll be asked to put the quality control project on 
       hold once the first new crisis appears at work. What, you have no crises at your job? Maybe I 
       should come and work for you.</p>
       <p>To make your case with management, you need to convince them that</p>
       <ol>
            <li>
            variation exists in all processes,<li>
            variation comes in two flavors, and<li>
            there are established ways to reduce variation.</ol>
       <p><b>Variation exists in all processes.</b> This is something that should be obvious, but we 
       often forget it. Here's a simple exercise to illustrate this. Perform the exercise in the box 
       before you read any further.</p>
       <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/quality01.gif"></p>
       <p>There are several reasons why two different people could come up with different answers to 
       this exercise. First, there is human error, it's easy to miss things. Second there are 
       ambiguous situations-did you include the sentence of instructions in your count? Third, 
       people may apply different standards-do you include capital letters in your count?</p>
       <p>If variation exists in a simple exercise like this, how much more likely is it to occur in 
       a complex work process?</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p><b>Exercise:</b> Select a work process in your area. List all of the possible causes 
            for variation in that work process.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p><b>Variation comes in two flavors. </b>Not all types of variation are the same, and 
       treating them so creates problems. <b>Common causes</b> of variation are factors that are 
       present at all times that contribute to variation in all of the output from a work process.
       <b>Special causes</b> of variation are factors which appears sporadically and contribute to 
       variation for only some of the output from a process. Special causes can usually be assigned 
       to a particular source.</p>
       <p>Deming had a <b>&quot;red bead&quot; exercise</b> that he used in all his course. Five volunteer 
       workers would dip their paddles into a bag of red and white beads in order to &quot;produce&quot; white 
       beads. Inspectors count the number of defective (red) beads and then Deming praises or 
       chastises the workers according to their output. A second round of production ensues and the 
       workers who did well the first time slip back and those who did poorly end up doing better. 
       The cycle continues with Deming trying to exhort the workers to do better, when it was 
       actually the process itself that was causing the variation.</p>
       <p>The red bead experiment is a classic example of taking a common cause of variation and 
       labeling it a special cause. Managers love to do this. Any small change in the process has to 
       have a &quot;variance report&quot; that finds a specific person of thing to blame.</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p><b>Exercise:</b> examine the sources of variation in the previous exercise. Classify 
            them as common cause or special cause variation.</p>
       </blockquote>
       <p><b>There are established ways to reduce variation.</b> There are good and bad ways to 
       reduce variation, but unfortunately there are more bad ways than good ways. Here are some 
       examples of bad ways to reduce variation:</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        Rewards and punishments.<li>
        Posters and slogans.<li>
        Blame the workers.</ul>
       <p>The best way to reduce variation is to identify special causes of variation and then 
       remove them. Once the special causes are gone, you have a stable process that is amenable to 
       experimentation. Run experiments to remove common causes of variation.</p>
       <p><b>Identify and remove special causes.</b> This step has to come first. Monitor your 
       process using a control chart when you find a point out of control, investigate and find the 
       assignable cause to that out of control point. Fix that problem and continue to monitor the 
       work process.</p>
       <p><b>Identify and remove common causes.</b> This step has to come second. Once the process 
       is in control, you then have to identify common factors that influence all of the output. 
       Manipulate these common factors in experiments to reduce variation.</p>
       <p>It's very important to remove all special causes first. You can't run an experiment 
       effectively if there are special causes which appear at unexpected times. They'll contaminate 
       the experiment and make the results much harder to interpret.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Step 2. Measure your process.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>It was Socrates who first said&nbsp; that an unexamined life is not worth living. As a 
       professional statistician, I believe that an unanalyzed data set is not worth collecting. 
       There are several ways to measure a work process.</p>
       <ol>
            <li>
            Flow diagrams<li>
            Pareto charts<li>
            Cause and effect diagrams<li>
            Control charts</ol>
       <p>There are plenty of resources for how to use each of these tools, but the key question 
       should be, what should I measure? My advice is to start small and start well downstream.</p>
       <p><b>Start small.</b> There is a large start-up cost for a quality control program and you 
       don't want to try to do everything at once. Look for the low hanging fruit--those areas where 
       it is easy to measure things and where there is a strong prospect for time/money savings.</p>
       <p><b>Start well downstream.</b> By &quot;downstream,&quot; I mean near the end of the entire work 
       process. Measure something that represents the end-product--what the customer sees. As you 
       start to understand the end-product better then you will need to look at some of the 
       intermediate processes that contribute to the end-product. This is moving upstream.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Step 3. Experiment.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Once you have established a stable process, you want to improve that process, either by 
       lowering the mean or shrinking the width of the control limits. Experimentation is the key to 
       either approach.</p>
       <p>When you run an experiment, you should follow the PDSA cycle (Plan-Do-Study-Act).</p>
       <p><b>Plan.</b> What sort of change to the work process are you considering? What is the 
       current work process? How well/poorly does the current work process do?</p>
       <p><b>Do.</b> Implement the planned change. Measure the impact of the change.</p>
       <p><b>Study.</b> Analyze the measurements. Did the change make things better or worse?</p>
       <p><b>Act.</b> If the change is better, implement that change in all future work. Make sure 
       that the change persists.</p>
       <p>The whole experiment will probably raise new questions to study, which starts the whole 
       cycle over again.</p>
       <blockquote>
            <p><b>Exercise:</b> All four steps in the PDSA cycle are important. What happens if skip 
            the Study step? What happens if you skip the Act step?</p>
       </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Summary</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Setting up a quality program is not easy. First <b>get management support</b>. Without 
       that support all your efforts will be refocussed at the first work crisis. Second, <b>measure 
       your process</b>. Start small and start well downstream. Third, <b>experiment</b>. Follow the 
       plan, do, study, act cycle.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Rules for identifying special causes.</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>There are many rules that have been proposed for deciding when a special cause has 
       occurred. A good summary of these rules appears on pages 135-140 of Wheeler (1995).</p>
       <p>The simplest rule, and the one that appears to be universally adopted is when <b>a single 
       point lies outside the control limits</b>. This indicates a sudden large shift in the 
       process.</p>
       <p>A second rule is to declare a special cause variation when <b>eight consecutive points lie 
       on the same side of the center line</b>. This rule is attractive because it is simple to 
       apply and it is sensitive to gradual shifts or trends that the first rule might miss.</p>
       <p><b>Other rules involve dividing the control chart into zones</b> (e.g., more than one 
       standard deviation from the center line, more than two standard deviations from the center 
       line) and noting whether two out of three or three out of four points fall into certain 
       zones. There are also rules about a <b>sequence of consecutively increasing or consecutively 
       decreasing points</b> or a <b>sequence that hops too frequently</b> from one side to the 
       other of the center line or a <b>sequence that hugs too closely to the center line</b>.</p>
       <p>On page 139, Wheeler warns that <b>too many rules increase the chances for a false alarm</b>. 
       The first two rules (one point outside control limits; eight consecutive points on the same 
       side of the center line) work very well in practice and <b>there is little justification for 
       adopting more complex rules</b>. This is especially true if you are just starting out with a 
       quality control program.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Control charts for individual values</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Sometimes, there is no easy way to grab a batch of two or more measurements. The 
       measurements that you get are <b>distinct and cannot be put into batches</b> without some 
       degree of &quot;ad hoc&quot;ery. For these situation, an XmR chart works well. Here is an example.</p>
       <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/quality14.gif"><br>
       <img border="0" src="../01/images/quality15.gif"></p>
       <p>This example appears in section 6.4 of Wheeler and Poling (1998). The data represents 
       accounts receivable as a percentage of sales. This is an important accounting ratio that 
       describes how quickly bills are collected. A large percentage is bad and indicates that 
       accounts receivable tends to be slow or overdue.</p>
       <p>Rather than compute a range within a batch, a moving range is computed. <b>The moving 
       range is the range between each successive pair of observations.</b> The moving range 
       provides an alternative method for measuring short term variation. The average of the moving 
       ranges is used to compute control limits using formulas similar to those shown above.</p>

  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/quality10.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>There is also a moving range chart for this data, which I do not display.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Control charts for counts</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>There are several control chart choices when your data represents counts. The simplest 
       choice is the c-chart. Here's an example that appears on page 272 of</p>
       <ul>
        <li>
        <b>SPC for the Rest of Us: A Personal Path to Statistical Control.</b> Hy Pitt (1994) 
        Reading, Massachusetts: Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc.
        <a href="http://www.bookfinder4u.com/detail/0201563665.html">[BookFinder4U link]</a> <b>
        (Statistics, Control Charts)</b></ul>
       <p>The data appears below:</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/quality18.gif"></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>The average number of defects is</p>
       <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/quality25.gif"></p>
       <p>The formula for the control limits is</p>
       <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/quality24.gif"></p>
       <p>In this example, the lower control limit is negative, which is impossible. When this 
       happens, you should set the lower control limit to zero. The control chart looks like the 
       following:</p>
       <p><img border="0" src="../01/images/quality13.gif"></p>
       <p>Note that <b>any number of defects from 0 to 5 would be considered common cause variation</b>. 
       There are two special causes to investigate: hoods #6 and #13. Although the author of this 
       example does not give a specific explanation for these two points, he does offer the 
       following possibilities: differences in the diligence or training among inspectors; a 
       counting/recording error; or some change in the manufacturing process itself.</p>
       <p>The C chart has potential application to the surveillance of employee injuries and 
       illnesses. An example of such a chart even appears in the book Wheeler and Poling (page 186). 
       Nevertheless, there are <b>several difficulties with using a C chart for injuries and 
       illnesses</b>.</p>
       <p>First, the assumptions of a Poisson distribution are questionable. If injuries and 
       illnesses events in one month are correlated with one another, then the assumptions are a 
       Poisson distribution are violated. A simple example of correlation would be if one of the 
       illness categories represented an infectious disease like influenza. The assumptions of the 
       Poisson distribution are also violated if there is heterogeneity in the distribution of 
       injury and illness events. This might occur if certain times of the months, certain 
       employees, or certain areas of the workplace, are more prone (or less prone) to have specific 
       injuries and illnesses.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b>Which chart should I use?</b></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>Eventually, you should learn how to run a wide range of control charts. But to start with, 
       I would encourage you to <b>learn the XmR chart first</b>. This is the simplest and most 
       versatile chart and can handle most commonly encountered situations. It is not always as 
       efficient as an Xbar/Rbar chart, but <b>simplicity rather than efficiency is more important</b> 
       when you are just starting.</p>
