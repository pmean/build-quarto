<p><strong>General guide to data entry (created 1999-09-03)</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/steps-in-data-entry/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><i>Dear Professor Mean, I'm about to start typing in my research data. Do you 
 have any general guidelines for data entry?</i></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Spreadsheets allow you enormous flexibility in how you enter your data.
   <strong>But beware, for if your spreadsheet is loosely structured, you could 
   encounter difficulties when you import the data into statistical software 
   like SPSS</strong>. If you follow these general guidelines for data entry, 
   the data import will go smoothly. </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Arrange your data in rectangular format.</li>
    <li>Create codes for any missing values.</li>
    <li>Create variable names (8 characters or less).</li>
    <li>Assign number codes for categorical data.</li>
    <li>Provide a unique id for each row of your data.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>Here are more details about each guideline. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Arrange your data in rectangular format.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Arrange your data in a rectangular format. <strong>The intersection of each 
   row and column should contain a single number</strong>. Here's an example of 
   data which does not fit into a rectangular format. These data are loosely 
   based on a study of breast feeding in pre-term infants. The data have been 
   shortened and modified to serve as a simple example of data entry.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>Breast feeding status at six months

No                   Yes                  Lost to follow-up

Mom's Marital Birth  Mom's Marital Birth  Mom's Marital Birth
Age   Status  Weight Age   Status  Weight Age   Status  Weight

 18   Married 1.550   28   Single  2.381   28   Married 1.685
 33   Single  1.990                1.130                2.435
 34   Married         26   Married 2.060
 36   Married 1.640</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>Notice the jagged shape of the data. There is a 4 by 3 block of data (the 
   No group), and then a 3 by 3 block of data (the Yes group), and then a 2 by 3 
   block of data (the Lost to follow-up group). If we stack these blocks one 
   beneath another rather than one beside another, we will get a rectangular 
   shape. When we re-arrange the data, however, we need to include an extra 
   column of information to designate the specific block/group. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here is what the data looks like after we re-arrange it into a rectangular 
   format. </p>
</blockquote>
<pre>Breast
Feeding  Mom's Marital Birth
Status   Age   Status  Weight

 No       18   Married 1.550
 No       33   Single  1.990
 No       34   Married      
 No       36   Married 1.640
 Yes      28   Single  2.381
 Yes                   1.130
 Yes      26   Married 2.060
 Lost     28   Married 1.685
 Lost                  2.435</pre>
<p><strong>2. Create codes for missing values.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Even after re-arranging the data in rectangular format, there are still 
   some blank spots in this data. These represents missing data. <strong>Never 
   let a empty field represent missing data</strong>. Explicitly create a code 
   for missing, and be sure to explain why the data are missing to anyone 
   involved with analysis of your data. In this example, let -1 represent a 
   missing value for Mom's Age and Birth Weight. Let 9 represent a missing value 
   for Marital Status. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>Here's what the data looks like when we plug up the missing value holes.</p>

<pre>Breast
Feeding  Mom's Marital Birth
Status   Age   Status  Weight

 No       18   Married 1.550
 No       33   Single  1.990
 No       34   Married    -1
 No       36   Married 1.640
 Yes      28   Single  2.381
 Yes      -1      9    1.130
 Yes      26   Married 2.060
 Lost     28   Married 1.685
 Lost     -1      9    2.435</pre>
<p><strong>3. Create variable names.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you are using a spreadsheet, place a descriptive variable name at the 
   top of each column. If you are using a database, provide a descriptive name 
   for each field. You will use this variable or field name in statistical 
   software like SPSS to specify the variables that you want to analyze. <strong>
   Try to be reasonably descriptive with your variable names; avoid generic 
   names like VAR01, VAR02, etc.</strong> </p>
  <p>While a spreadsheet or a database generally places few restrictions on 
   variable names, most statistical software (including SPSS) will not be able 
   to handle long names or names with special symbols. Here are some general 
   guidelines that will help avoid trouble. </p>
  <p><strong>Use eight characters or less</strong>. If you try to use a longer 
   name, SPSS and most other statistical software will truncate the name to the 
   first eight characters. It's a challenge to provide a descriptive name when 
   you are limited to eight characters, but try your best. SPSS will later allow 
   you to provide lengthier and more detailed description in the variable label.
  </p>
  <p><strong>A mixture of numbers and letters is okay, but avoid special symbols 
   such as $, &amp;, or %</strong>. Most statistical software will reserve these 
   special symbols for other purposes. The one major exception is the underscore 
   (_), which is found usually paired on the same key with the minus sign. In 
   fact, when SPSS imports names with special characters, it replaces them with 
   the underscore character. </p>
  <p><strong>Avoid embedded blanks</strong>. In most statistical software, an 
   embedded blank will cause the software to presume that you are referring to 
   two variables. SPSS, for example, gets confused when you ask for a histogram 
   for <tt>mom age</tt> and will try instead to product two histograms, one for
   <tt>mom</tt> and one for <tt>age</tt>. Here's where the underscore comes in 
   handy. The variable <tt>mom_age</tt> is easy to read. Compare this to the 
   alternative, <tt>momage</tt>, which looks like a nonsense word rhyming with 
   homage. </p>
  <p><strong>Finally, don't rely on upper/lower case to distinguish among 
   variable names</strong> (for example, don't name one variable <tt>x</tt> and 
   the next one <tt>X</tt>). Some packages are case insensitive. SPSS, for 
   example, will convert your variable name to all lower case. </p>
  <p>Here's what the data set looks like with variable names. </p>

 Lost      -1        9      2.435</pre>
<p><strong>4. Assign number codes for categorical data</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If you have categorical data, assign a code to each category level. Use the 
   code during data entry to save time and minimize errors. </p>
  <p>Here are some examples of codes: Gender 1=Male, 2=Female, 9=Unknown; Race 
   1=White, 2=Black, 3=Asian, 4=Hispanic, 5=Native American, 8=Multiracial, 
   9=Unknown; Likert scale 1=Strongly Disagree, 2=Disagree, 3=Neutral, 4=Agree, 
   5=Strongly Agree, 9=No answer. </p>
  <p><strong>While I prefer to use number codes, there are some advantages to 
   using short letter codes</strong>. Here are some examples of letter codes: 
   Gender M, F, and U (Male, Female, and Unknown); Race W, B, A, H, N, M, and U 
   (White, Black, Asian-American, Hispanic, Native American, Mixed, and 
   Unknown); Likert scale SD, D, N, A, SA, NA (Strongly Disagree, Disagree, 
   Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree, No Answer). Letter codes are easier to 
   remember, and sometimes can be used effectively as plotting symbols. </p>
  <p><strong>I prefer number codes because they offer more flexibility during 
   statistical analysis</strong>. For example, SPSS will not allow you to draw a 
   scatterplot when one of your variables uses letter codes. Other software will 
   alphabetize your letter codes, which may not be what you intended. For 
   example, an alphabetized Likert scale would be printed in the following 
   meaningless order: Agree, Disagree, Neutral, No Answer, Strongly Agree, 
   Strongly Disagree. </p>
  <p>Let's assign number codes for the categorical variables in the breast 
   feeding data example. For br_feed, let 0=No, 1=Yes, and 9=Lost. For mar_st, 
   let 0=Single; 1=Married, and 9=Missing. With this change, the data will look 
   like this:</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>br_feed  mom_age  mar_st   birth_wt
   0        18       1       1.550
   0        33       0       1.990
   0        34       1          -1
   0        36       1       1.640
   1        28       0       2.381
   1        -1       9       1.130
   1        26       1       2.060
   9        28       1       1.685
   9        -1       9       2.435</pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>Whether you use number or letter codes, though, do make it a habit to 
   document those codes. In SPSS, that means defining value labels for each and 
   every categorical variable. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>5. Provide a unique id for each row of your data</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>If practical, place a unique code in each row. <strong>A unique ID makes it 
   much easier to track down errors during data entry</strong>. Unique codes are 
   critical if you plan to combine your data with data from another source. The 
   data we have been using above came from a medical records system called 
   Meditech. In Meditech, each patient is assigned a special id code. Here is 
   the data set with those id codes inserted.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>  id        br_feed  mom_age  mar_st   birth_wt
J760223         0        18       1       1.550
J676434         0        33       0       1.990
J689673         0        34       1          -1
J785310         0        36       1       1.640
J703538         1        28       0       2.381
J675836         1        -1       9       1.130
J785827         1        26       1       2.060
J562494         9        28       1       1.685
J675320         9        -1       9       2.435</pre>
<p>With these id codes in place, we can quickly investigate any outliers that we 
 encounter during our data analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Before you start entering data, organize your data in the following ways.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Arrange your data in rectangular format.</li>
    <li>Create codes for any missing values.</li>
    <li>Create variable names (8 characters or less).</li>
    <li>Assign number codes for categorical data.</li>
    <li>Provide a unique id for each row of your data.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Follow these steps before entering your data and you will simplify 
   the process of importing your data into a statistical software package like 
   SPSS. </strong></p>
