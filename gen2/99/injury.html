<p><b>Injury index creation (September 23, 1999)</b></p>
  
<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/creating-injury-index/">new website</a>.</p>  
  
  <p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I want to create an injury index that describes the severity of an 
  injury to a child. This would include information about the type of injury, the location of the 
  injury, the age of the child, etc. What's the best way to do this?</em></p>
 <blockquote>
       <p>It seems to me like you have two choices. First, you can <strong>build an index based on 
       your judgment, intuition, and knowledge of medicine</strong>. You might let a few graphs and 
       tables of your data give you some guidance, but the predominant emphasis is on what the 
       knowledge and experience that you have accumulated over time. You might get other humans 
       involved by asking them to review and critique your index.</p>
       <p>Second, you can <strong>let an automated procedure create the index for you</strong>. You 
       might tweak things a bit, but the computer does most of the work for you. There are a variety 
       of tools, such as stepwise regression, factor analysis, neural nets, classification and 
       regression trees, and cluster analysis that might help here.</p>
       <p>With either approach, of course, you have to <strong>take the time to look at validity and 
       reliability</strong>. You are probably already more familiar with how to do this than I am.</p>
       <p>I would <strong>strongly urge you to build your own index rather than letting a machine 
       build it for you</strong>. If you don't feel like you know enough to build an index on your 
       own, how will you be able to critically evaluate an index that your automated procedure 
       creates? Also, the number of variables you have is small enough that you can sift through 
       them easily. A lot of these automated procedures shine when you have hundreds or thousands of 
       variables to consider in your index. They also work well when you have thousands or millions 
       of cases to examine. I suspect that your data set is not quite this large.</p>
