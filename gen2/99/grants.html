<p><strong>Writing a research grant (September 13, 1999)</strong> </p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/steps-in-writing-research-grant/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, </font>I'm writing a 
 research grant to look at the impact of managed care on the care of children 
 with chronic epilepsy. How do I structure the grant so I'm guaranteed to get 
 funding? -- Ambitious Ann</em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Ambitious,</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You're writing a research grant, and you want 
  Professor Mean to guarantee your funding? I can't do that, but if you mention 
  my name at McDonald's you can get 10% off on your order of french fries.</font></p>
<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>
<p>It's tricky to provide advice on how to write a grant, because each 
   research problem is different and each granting agency has its own 
   guidelines. I can outline a few of the things that I look for when I am asked 
   to help write or revise a grant application.</p>
<p>First, you need to have a <strong>theme</strong>, which I also refer to as 
   a <strong>primary objective</strong>. Your primary objective needs to be
  <strong>precise, prominent, and persistent</strong>. Your primary objective 
   will serve to unify the writing of your proposal.</p>
<p>Second, you need to outline your <strong>research plan</strong>. You should 
   specify <strong>what</strong> you plan to do, <strong>who</strong> you plan 
   to do it to, <strong>how</strong> you plan to evaluate your work, and <strong>
   why</strong> you are doing this research.</p>
<p>Third, you need to make your proposal <strong>easy to read</strong>. An 
   abstract on the first page and a summary at the end provides <strong>
   organization</strong> to your proposal. Make your proposal <strong>skimmable</strong> 
  by highlighting important points with bullets, numbered lists, and tables. 
  Keep your proposal <strong>simple</strong>, as much as is possible for 
   innovative research, by using analogies and avoiding OMAs (Obscure Medical 
   Acronyms).</p>
<p>Fourth, write from the <strong>perspective of the reviewer</strong>. Your 
   reviewers want information about the <strong>benefits</strong> of your 
   research. They want <strong>reassurance</strong> that you are qualified to 
   perform this research and that you have plans to handle unexpected problems. 
   They also want to see <strong>consistency</strong> between your work and the 
   interests and priorities of the granting agency.</p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">More details</font></strong></p>
<p>There are four things you should think about when writing a research grant</p>
<ol>
  <li>Theme</li>
  <li>Blueprint</li>
  <li>Legibility</li>
  <li>Perspective</li>
</ol>
<p>Before I discuss each of these points, I need to outline some general 
   categories of research.</p>
<p><strong>Three general categories of research</strong></p>
<p>There are many different types of research, so it is hard to describe what 
   your plan should look like. I place research into three general categories:</p>
<ul>
  <li>evaluating a treatment</li>
  <li>evaluating an exposure</li>
  <li>describing a population</li>
</ul>
<p>. These categories aren't perfect, but help guide further discussion about 
   writing grants.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating a treatment</strong></p>
<p>Some research evaluates an active treatment or intervention for some or all 
   of your research subjects. You will <strong>intervene throug the use of 
   medication, surgery, or some other typoe of medical therapy</strong>. For 
   this type of research, be sure to provide a detailed description of your 
   treatment or intervention. Be specific. For example, we plan to hold offer a 
   comprehensive weight loss program that includes education about diet, 
   opportunities for exercise, and group counseling sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating an exposure</strong></p>
<p>Other research may involve an exposure rather than an intervention. The 
   distinction is that <strong>an exposure is not under the direct control of 
   the researcher</strong>. An example of exposure is breast feeding, which is a 
   choice made by the individual mothers rather than the researcher.</p>
<p><strong>Describing a population</strong></p>
<p>Still other research studies are descriptive; they <strong>characterize 
   individual variables and/or relationships among these variables</strong>. 
   There are no treatments or exposures in this type of research. An example 
   would be a description of pediatric patients who visit an emergency 
   department. For this type of research, you would be interested in the average 
   age, the proportion who have insurance, and the correlation between waiting 
   time and staffing levels.</p>
<p><strong>1. Theme: Develop a primary objective</strong>.</p>
<p>Your proposal should have a <strong>unifying theme</strong>. I will refer 
   to this theme as a &quot;primary objective&quot; though some granting agencies may 
   prefer to use nouns like aim, hypothesis, or goal in place of objective. It's 
   important to understand the language that is commonly used by the researchers 
   in your area. When they get bored, they invent criticisms like &quot;this 
   researcher is naive because he/she confused the aims with the objectives.&quot; 
  These are the same people who argue about how toilet paper rolls should be 
  hung in your bathroom. </p>
<p>Whatever you decide to call it, you must have a primary objective. It 
   provides a unifying theme to your research proposal. Your primary objective 
   should be: </p>
<ul>
  <li>precise</li>
  <li>prominent</li>
  <li>persistent</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Precise</strong>.</p>
<p>You should e<strong>xplain your primary objective briefly and succinctly</strong>. 
   Use a single sentence, if possible. You don't want to ramble. Also be sure to 
   use clear and unambiguous language in your primary objective. </p>
<p><strong>Prominent</strong>.</p>
<p>You should <strong>highlight your primary objective so that it is obvious 
   even to someone who just skims your proposal</strong>. This is not the time 
   to be subtle. If the grant format allows it, mention your primary objective 
   on the very first page of your proposal. Otherwise, draw attention to your 
   primary objective by using a text box, shading, or bold formatting. Use 
   language like &quot;the primary objective of this study is&quot; that identifies your 
   theme unmistakably to your reviewers<strong>. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Persistent</strong>.</p>
<p>You should refer constantly to your primary objective throughout your 
   proposal. <strong>Repeat your primary objective at every possible opportunity</strong>. 
   You can do this implicitly by paraphrasing your primary objective or you can 
   directly restate your primary objective in part or in whole. Repetition will 
   reinforce your message and will force you to keep your proposal focussed.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure that you have a primary objective and that you gauge all 
  the material in your proposal against this. Revise or remove any material 
  that is inconsistent with or unrelated to your primary objective.</strong></p>
<p><strong>2. Blueprint: Outline the plan for your research</strong>.</p>
<p>State very early in your proposal what your research plan is. If the format 
   allows it, give a brief overview of your research plan on the first page of 
   your proposal. The plan should address: </p>
<ul>
  <li>what you plan to do</li>
  <li>who you plan to do it to</li>
  <li>how you plan to evaluate it</li>
  <li>why you plan to do it</li>
</ul>
<p>I will illustrate these points with an imaginary research study where we 
   develop an expensive seminar to convince people that they would be happier if 
   they gave us all their money.</p>
<p><strong>What you plan to do</strong>.</p>
<p>In an intervention study, you should describe in detail <strong>what that 
   intervention is</strong>. You should also describe <strong>how you will 
   randomize</strong>, and <strong>what efforts will be made to blind the 
   intervention</strong>. Not all interventions can be totally blinded, of 
   course, but you should keep the allocation to the treatment or control group 
   hidden until the patient has agreed to participate and the recruiting 
   physician has verified that the patient is eligible.</p>
<p>For an exposure study, you should focus on <strong>efforts to make your 
   control group as similar as possible to the exposure group</strong>. Describe
  <strong>any efforts to match</strong>, for example, or <strong>list potential 
   confounding variables</strong> and explain how you will adjust for them.</p>
<p>For both an intervention study or an exposure study, you should also 
   describe <strong>any outcome measures that you plan to collect</strong>. 
   Outcome variables are those variables that you believe that the treatment or 
   exposure might influence. These measures should be specific, reliable, and 
   valid.</p>
<p>If your intervention is supposed to make your patients poor and happy, you 
   need to provide an <strong>operational definition of poverty</strong> and use 
   a survey instrument that has been shown by other researchers to be a <strong>
   valid and reliable indicator of happiness</strong>. </p>
<p>If you have multiple outcome measures, you should list all of them in a 
   table. If some of your measures are more important than others, indicate this 
   priority by designating primary and secondary outcome measures.</p>
<p>In a descriptive study, you should focus on measurement. List all the 
   variables that you plan to measure. If any variables are difficult to 
   measure, explain how you will measure them.</p>
<p><strong>Who you plan to do it to</strong>.</p>
<p>Describe the subjects that you plan to study. Detail <strong>what type of 
   subjects you will include</strong> in your research and <strong>what type of 
   subjects you will exclude</strong>. For example, all our patients must be 
   rich and gullible. We will exclude any reporters and law enforcement officers 
   from our study. </p>
<p>Document <strong>how many of these subjects you will see in a year</strong> 
  and estimate <strong>how many of them will agree to participate</strong> in 
   your research. Also estimate the <strong>proportion of subjects who will drop 
   out</strong> during the study. You may not have a very good idea about these 
   estimates, but you still provide your best guess so the reviewers know that 
   you are aware of the issues involving volunteers and dropouts.</p>
<p><strong>How you plan to evaluate your work</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Evaluation usually implies some type of comparison</strong>, 
   especially for intervention or exposure studies. This can be a &quot;<strong>before 
   and after</strong>&quot; comparison (before we intervened, our patients were rich 
   and miserable, now they are poor and happy). It can also be an <strong>
   internal comparison</strong> (those patients who attended only one session of 
   our intervention were still rich and miserable, but those who attended all 
   four are now poor and happy). Or it can be an <strong>external comparison</strong> 
  (those patients who attended our sessions were poorer and happier than a 
  control group who did not attend our sessions).</p>
<p>When your research involves comparison, you should specify <strong>how much 
   of a difference you consider clinically relevant</strong>. This information 
   will help you justify the sample size for your experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Not all research implies comparison</strong>. In most descriptive 
   studies, for example, the focus is on statistical estimates such as means and 
   correlations. In this case, you should <strong>specify how precise you want 
   those statistical estimates to be</strong>. That precision will help you 
   justify the sample soze for your experiment. </p>
<p><strong>Why you plan to do it.</strong></p>
<p>You need to provide a rationale for your research plan. Explain <strong>
  what you will learn</strong> from this research and <strong>who will it help</strong>. 
   This is an easy thing to ignore, because it is so obvious, at least to you. 
   Some of the &quot;why&quot; will already be in your literature review, but repeat and 
   expand on your rationale when you outline your research plan.</p>
<p><strong>3. Legibility: Make your proposal easy to read</strong>.</p>
<p>Reviewers will spend more time reading a proposal that they can read 
   quickly and easily. Less is more. It's better to have a 6,000 word proposal 
   that is read twice than an 8,000 word proposal that is read once. So say 
   less, but say it in a way that will invite the reviewers to read it a second 
   time. You do this by making your proposal:</p>
<ul>
  <li>organized</li>
  <li>skimmable</li>
  <li>simple</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Organized.</strong></p>
<p>An organized presentation is easier to read. If the grant guidelines allow 
   for it, include an <strong>abstract at the start</strong> of your proposal 
   and a <strong>summary at the end</strong>. The abstract and summary should 
   discuss your theme and your blueprint. If the reviewer only reads the first 
   page of your proposal or only the last page, make sure that the reviewer 
   would have a good idea of what you want to do.</p>
<p>Your grant should follow a logical progression. When you are reviewing the 
   literature, for example, <strong>start with the general and move to the 
   specific</strong>. This sets up the &quot;big picture&quot; and places your proposal in 
   the approprate context of the big picture.</p>
<p>When you are addressing a sequence of topics, <strong>use numbers to track 
   the progress of your sequence</strong>. The &quot;one, two, three&quot; provides 
   anchors of one, two, three, etc. that allow your reviewer to jump from point 
   to point.</p>
<p><strong>Don't write your grant proposal like a murder mystery</strong>. You 
   don't want to keep your reviewers guessing about what you plan to do while 
   you summarize the literature and all your previous research. Also use a 
   logical and predictable sequence (such as general to specific) to make your 
   proposal predictable. In short, you want to <strong>avoid any suspense or 
   surprises</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Skimmable</strong>.</p>
<p>You want to make it easy for reviewers to skim your proposal. Most 
  reviewers can't devote the amount of time to reviewing your proposal that you 
  (or they ) would like to. When you make your grant skimmable, you encourage 
  the reviewer to 'hit the high points&quot;. </p>
<p>Use a topic sentence at the start of each paragraph and make an obvious 
   transition from one topic sentence to the next topic sentence. This allows 
   the reviewer to review your proposal by reading the first sentence in each 
   paragraph.</p>
<p>Space improves skimmability. Use a large readable font. Include a lot of 
   white space.</p>
<p>Use section titles liberally. If the grant guidelines include specific 
   titles, use those title verbatim and in the same order as the guideline 
   suggests.</p>
<p>Use tables, numbered lists and/or bullets to highlight key information.</p>
<p>Don't cram. Cramming is the enemy of skimming. I understand that the 
   temptation to cram is strong. You want to fit in a bit of extra information. 
   So you lower the font size from 12 points to 11.5 and then 11. You fiddle 
   with the margins. You move some required information into the appendix. You 
   combine short paragraphs into long paragraphs. You take out a blank line here 
   and a blank line there. You take out some of the subheadings. And you end up 
   with a proposal that is dense. You're proud of yourself because you got an 
   extra 2,000 words into your proposal. Don't be so proud. In order to squeeze 
   in a few things, you've aggravated the people who will decide the fate of 
   your proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Simple</strong>.</p>
<p>Don't assume that the reviewer knows as much about your area of research as 
   you do. <strong>Avoid jargon and minimize the number of acronyms that you use</strong>. 
   If you have to use acronyms, be sure to define them at their first 
   appearance. Also, keep the acronyms out of your abstract and out of your 
   research hypotheses. If you can't avoid using a large number of acronyms, put 
   in a table that lists all of them.</p>
<p>You should adopt a <strong>tutorial approach to the new and unusual aspects 
   of your research</strong>. Take advantage of any analogies about your work. 
   Although it may appear as oversimplification, you should remember that
  <strong>no one understands your research as well as you do</strong>. If your 
   reviewers don't uderstand your research, they will have a hard time 
   supporting it. We all have a tendency to mistrust those things that we don't 
   understand. Make sure your reviewers understand your science.</p>
<p>Your writing style can also help simplify your proposal. <strong>Use short 
   sentences</strong>. You should, for example, split any sentence into two or 
   more sentences whenever you see the word &quot;and&quot; appearing more than once.
  <strong>Also use short paragraphs</strong>. Not only does this improve 
   skimmability (see above), it also makes it easier for the reviewer to stay on 
   track. <strong>Keep your nouns and verbs close to one another</strong>. A 
   sentence with a lot intervening words between the subject and predicate 
   unnecessarily causes confusion. With the subject and predicate close 
   together, your reader will better understand your material.</p>
<p><strong>4. Perspective: Put yourself in the shoes of the reviewer</strong>.</p>
<p>Your motivation for seeking a grant will rarely be the same as the 
   motivation of the person who is giving the grant. Try to understand what your 
   reviewers want and give it to them.</p>
<p>Reviewers are looking for four things: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Generalizability</li>
  <li>Benefits</li>
  <li>Reassurance</li>
  <li>Consistency</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Generalizability</strong></p>
<p>One important motivator for reviewers is generalizability. <strong>If the 
   work you plan has implications for a lot of patients beyond those that you 
   plan to study, then be sure to brag about this</strong>. You are providing 
   leverage; the money spent on your proposal will go a long way. For example, 
   if you are examining the coping skills of children with chronic arthritis, 
   mention how this work will provide direction for coping skills of children 
   with other chronic diseases. If you are examining barriers to health care 
   among Spanish speaking patients, emphasize how this will serve as a model for 
   other language barriers.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits</strong></p>
<p>The reviewer wants to understand the benefits of your work. This is not the 
   time to be dispassionate. Let your enthusiasm for your research shine 
   through. <strong>Advocate the value of your work through the severity of the 
   illness and/or the number of people affected</strong>. Explain how your work 
   fits into &quot;the big picture.&quot;</p>
<p>Although you need to be an advocate, you should <strong>avoid sounding 
   close-minded</strong>. Too strong an emphasis can give the impression that 
   you already know the answer and you won't let any data get in the way. Avoid 
   any overtly partisan language that might lead the reviewers to believe you 
   are biased.</p>
<p>Part of your advocacy will be <strong>stating how your approach is the best</strong>. 
   If you can't explain why your approach is the best, you shouldn't be applying 
   for the grant. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't acknowledge the 
   shortcomings of your approach. You should, so the reviewers appreciate your 
   realism. Also you need to acknowledge other approaches and compare their 
   strengths and weaknesses to your approach.</p>
<p>Being an advocate without sounding partisan may sound contradictory, but 
   you should simply avoid any extremes. <strong>Either a totally dispassionate 
   presentation or a fanatical zealotry will turn off your reviewers</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Reassurance</strong></p>
<p>The reviewers also want reassurance. They want to feel confident the money 
   will be spent well and there will be a good return on the agency's 
   investment. Some things that reassure your reviewers are: </p>
<ol>
  <li>the <strong>training, experience, and resources</strong> you have to 
    conduct this research</li>
  <li>an <strong>explicit time frame</strong> for completion of specific parts 
    of your research</li>
  <li>a list <strong>possible problems</strong> that may occur during your 
    research and <strong>how you plan to handle them</strong>. </li>
  <li>a plan for <strong>how you will disseminate the results</strong> of your 
    work</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also build confidence in your proposal by presenting a <strong>
  realistic plan and budget</strong> and demonstrating <strong>care and 
   attention to details</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency</strong></p>
<p>If you want to be successful at writing grants, you need to <strong>
  understand the agency that you are applying to</strong>. What are their 
   interests and priorities? Write your proposal to show consistency with these 
   interests and priorities.</p>
<p>This is easy to do. Every agency will have <strong>guidelines for grant 
   writers</strong> that will tell you what they are interested in. If you are 
   like me, you don't want to bother reading these guidelines. It's like using 
   software without reading the documentation. But reading the guidelines is 
   very important.</p>
<p>Some things you want to look for in the guidelines are: </p>
<ol>
  <li>the purpose of this particular granting program</li>
  <li>the eligibility criteria</li>
  <li>the grant deadlines</li>
  <li>the money limits</li>
  <li>start date and duration</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some excerpts from a grant guideline.</p>
<p>1. Purpose: <em>invite applications for pilot studies to explore 
   interventions for prevention of obesity in high risk individuals or 
   populations. Applications incorporating unique cultural or social features 
   specific for women or for special populations defined by race/ethnicity 
   and/or socioeconomic status are encouraged</em>. </p>
<p>2. Eligibility: <em>Applications may be submitted by domestic and foreign, 
   for-profit and non-profit organizaitons, public and private, such as 
   universities, colleges, hospitals, laboratories, units of State and local 
   governments, and eligible agencies of the Federal Government</em>. </p>
<p>3. Deadlines: <em>Letter of Intent Receipt Date: March 26, 1999 Application 
   Receipt Date: April 27, 1999</em> </p>
<p>4. Money: <em>grants will be limited to $125,000 in direct costs in the 
   first year and a maximum of $375,000 in direct costs over a three year period</em>.
</p>
<p>5. Start date and duration: <em>The anticipated award date is September 30, 
   1999. It is intended that the three years of funding provided for these pilot 
   studies will allow 18-24 months of treatment and/or follow-up to be included 
   in the proposed study designs. </em></p>
<p>Also listed in this grant are three areas that you application should 
   address: <em>Applications should address: the content of the intervention 
   (e.g., relative focus on aspects of diet, physical activity, both, or other 
   factors), the setting of the intervention (e.g., in health care settings, 
   community groups, social groups, home, school), and the method of 
   intervention delivery (e.g., individual, group, computer-aided, 
   internet-based, mass media). Novel or innovative aspects and the rationale 
   for their use should be highlighted</em>.</p>
<p>This is something you should tape to the side of your computer monitor as 
   you write your grant. Address each one of these points in detail and be sure 
   to address them in the order in which they are stated. </p>
<p>There are other things you can and should do beyond reading the grant 
   guidelines. Many granting agencies have a program official who is available 
   to discuss your proposal. Take advantage of this person's expertise.</p>
<p>You should also visit the granting agency's web site. Look for a mission 
   statement and try to show how your grant will help that agency achieve its 
   mission. For example the mission statement for NIOSH (National Institute for 
   Occupational Safety and Health: <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh">
   www.cdc.gov/niosh</a>) is: <em>Delivering on the Nation's promise: Safety and 
   health at work for all people through research and prevention.</em> If you 
   are applying for a NIOSH grant, be sure to adress any aspects of your work 
   that relate to safety, health, work, and prevention.</p>
<p>The web site might also list other information that you can draw on. NIOSH 
   has a page discussing <em>NORA. National Occupational Research Agenda: 21 
   priorities for the 21st century</em>. Be sure to show which of the 21 
   priorities your grant will address.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>It's difficult to provide a good example for two reasons. First, I do not 
   have the room or the energy to reproduce a 25 page proposal. Second, it is 
   easier for me to tell you how to write a good research grant than write one 
   myself.</p>
<p>I'm hoping to get some examples of successful research grants that I can 
   post online. If you have a research grant proposal that got funded and you 
   are willing to share an electronic version of it for these web pages, contact 
   me at </p>
