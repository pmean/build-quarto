 <p><em>Dear Professor Mean, Can the Chi-square test be used for anything besides categorical data?</em></p>
  <blockquote>
       <p>The Chi-square test exists in many different forms. It is useful for testing <strong>
       whether a categorical variable conforms to a set of hypothesized probabilities</strong>. It 
       can also test <strong>whether two categorical variables are independent</strong>. Both of 
       these tests involve comparing expected counts to observed counts.</p>
       <p>There is also a Chi-square test for examining <strong>whether a sample variance is equal 
       to a hypothesized value</strong>. For this test, you look at the ratio of the sample variance 
       to the hypothesized variance.</p>
       <p>Finally <b>many nonparametric tests rely on the Chi-square distribution as an 
       approximation</b> when you don't have exact tables available.</p>
