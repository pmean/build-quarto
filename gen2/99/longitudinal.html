<p><b>Longitudinal data analysis (no date)</b></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/steps-in-longitudinal-analysis/">new website</a>.</p>

<p>[This is a very early draft]</p>
<p>Longitudinal data are data where each patient is observed on multiple 
   occasions over time. Analysis of longitudinal data are challenging because 
   measurements on the same subject are correlated. Another way to think about 
   this is that two measurements on the same subject will have less variation 
   than two measurements on different subjects.</p>
<p>A closely related concept is the cluster design. A cluster design is one 
   where the researcher selects clusters of patients rather than selects 
   patients individually. For example, a researcher might randomly select 
   several families and evaluate all children in that family. As another 
   example, a researcher might randomly select several clinical practices and 
   then evaluate a random group of patients at each practice. In a cluster 
   design, two measurements on patients within the same cluster will have less 
   variations than measurements of two patients in differing clusters. . In 
   genetics, this correlation is of great interest, and can help you understand 
   concepts like heritability.</p>
<p>Many of the methods described below for longitudinal designs would also be 
   useful for cluster designs. For simplicity, I will discuss these methods 
   solely from the perspective of a longitudinal design.</p>
<p>If your data are continuous, then there are several &quot;classical&quot; approaches 
   such as multivariate analysis of variance and repeated measures analysis of 
   variance. These approaches work well for simple well structured longitudinal 
   data.</p>
<p>An alternative is to use mixed linear models. These models handle missing 
   data well and can handle situations where the times of measurement vary from 
   one patient to another.</p>
<p>In a mixed linear model, you specify a particular structure for the 
   correlations. For example, an autoregressive structure is commonly used to 
   represent structure where correlations are strongest for measurements close 
   in time and which become weaker for measurements that are further separated 
   in time.</p>
<p>In many situations, the correlations are not of direct interest, but we 
   only account for them because failure to do so will lead to incorrect 
   inferences.</p>
<p>When you are examining the correlation structure, a statistic called the 
   Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). This statistic measures how closely the 
   model fits the data, but it includes a penalty for overly complex models.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are two different formulas for AIC. For one formula, a 
   large value of AIC is good, and for the other formula, a small value is good.</p>
<p>AIC values should only be compared for models where the only change is in 
   the correlation structure. It would not make sense to compare an AIC from a 
   model with linear relationships to a model with quadratic relationships.</p>
<p>What if your data is not continuous? L. Fang discussed some of the 
   approaches commonly used when the data represents binomial counts.</p>
