<p><strong>Page's test (September 3, 1999)</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/what-is-page-test/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I have recently come across a statistical test 
 (Page's L test),with which I am unfamiliar. Does anyone either have information 
 about this test or know where I might find information about it.</em></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Page's test is a <strong>nonparametric test</strong>. It uses the ranks of 
   the data, rather than the data itself, so as to avoid any assumptions about 
   the underlying distribution of the data.</p>
  <p>Page's test is used as an alternative to Friedman's test when the <strong>
   treatments are ordered in a logical sequence</strong> (e.g., no therapy, 
   limited therapy, full therapy). Like Friedman's test, it is relevant when 
   each subject gets each treatment or when subjects are matched.</p>

  <p>A nice description of Page's test can be found on pages 284-292 of 
   Hollander and Wolfe's book on nonparametric statistics.</p>
