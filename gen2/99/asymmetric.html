<p><strong>Asymmetric confidence intervals (created 1999-09-03)</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/asymmetric-confidence-intervals/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I found a journal article with a confidence interval 
 that was asymmetric. For example, the authors reported a mortality difference 
 of 5% and a 95% confidence interval of -1.2% to 12%. I can't understand how the 
 CI can be unequally distributed if it uses the form ESTIMATE +/- 1.96*STANDARD 
</em></p>
  <p><strong>Not every confidence interval uses a plus or minus type formula</strong>. 
   The ones that don't are usually asymmetric. In particular, <strong>most 
   confidence intervals involving ratios are asymemmetric</strong> (though some 
   of them are symmetric on a log scale). Also <strong>confidence intervals that 
   take the small sample sizes into account are often asymmetric</strong>. It's 
   good that you remember your confidence interval formula from your Statistics 
   class, but your instructor probably didn't have time to show you every 
   possible confidence interval formula.</p>
