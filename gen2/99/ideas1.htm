<p>This is a plain text version of the final handout on getting research ideas. I got a
lot of requests for a copy, so in view of that, and the many excellent contributions to
the discussion, I thought it would be of general interest. The examples are medical, but
replacing them with ones from your own area is probably easy.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank the many people who took part in the discussion, or who wrote to me
privately, and to stress that the quotes in it are often the person who made the point
most memorably, rather than the only person who said it. </p>

<p>Introduction<br>
This paper tackles one of the questions that statisticians dread most: the most basic one
of all. How do you start formulating a research project? It began life as a talk at a
research seminar in the Rotunda Hospital, Dublin. Trying to write it up, I decided to mail
the statistics lists that I subscribe to. This paper has been greatly enriched by the
ideas and discussion generated on edstat-l, the statistics teaching list, as well as
contributions from subscribers to the stata list and the UK statistics list allstat.
Quotes are often attributed to the only person who made the point most memorably, but many
of the ideas emerged repeatedly in different postings. I'd like to thank all those who
took part in the discussion.</p>

<p>1. Exploring your environment</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do is identify your resources for research.This is often
easier when you first arrive somewhere. After a while you begin seeing an environment as
the place where you work or live or eat. You need to see it with a fresh eye to see it as
a potential research environment. </p>

<p>Don't forget that your research environment includes not just your patients and your
colleagues, but also includes any source of data, ideas or help that you have access to.
Many of my own research projects have taken shape because my office is next door to the
psychology department; a casual remark has often triggered a flurry of speculation,
articles rooted out, contacts mentioned and so on. </p>

<p>The internet is also a valuable environment. Discussion lists abound,which can provide
not just free advice but also an insight into current controversies and new directions in
research. Simply subscribing to a list and reading the postings (the word for a person who
does this is a lurker) without taking part in the discussions will often give you ideas.</p>

<p>Making an inventory of your resources:</p>

<p>1. What general resources have you that would help in your research? </p>

<p>1.1 How much time will you be able to devote to research? To what extent can you
integrate it into your daily work?<br>
1.2 Will colleagues help? For instance, if you need bloods taken outside working hours,
will the doctor on call oblige? Will nursing staff collaborate by collecting extra
information?<br>
1.3 Have you access to a person, unit or department with a specific research interest?
They can often be a useful source of ideas. Never underestimate the value of just going
for coffee with someone who does a lot of research, or, better, a research team. The speed
with which a bunch of researchers can take a vague idea and shape it into a research
design is amazing. Most of these ideas go nowhere, but eavesdropping on the process can
help you to do it yourself. </p>

<p>Giovanni Leonardi of the Environmental Epidemiology Unit at London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine put it like this: 'there are many potential research ideas that
never make it to becoming research projects, and the likelihood that a research idea will
become a research project is heavily influenced by this idea having being selected and
refined in an environment where potential ideas are routinely tested for their viability.
Think of this as &quot;natural selection&quot; of research ideas within the research
environment.' <br>
Have you access to a statistician, or someone who can advise you on study design and
sample size?</p>

<p>1.3 What library facilities have you access to? Skimming journals is a good ideas
generator, which I will deal with in more detail later; but access to a good library,
including literature searching and reprint ordering facilities, is a must. Add extra
points for library staff who are willing to do literature searching with you looking over
their shoulder to refine the search.</p>

<p>1.4 What computer facilities are available? Ideally you should be able to write your
own research papers and reports. This is helped greatly by being able to create tables and
graphs, so if you can't do this, learn. The next real bonus is having a dedicated
bibliographic package which you can use to store, organise and annotate your references,
and to generate bibliographies for papers -- well worth investing in. Finally, have you a
statistical package, or access to someone who will do your statistics for you? Ideally,
you should be able to examine your data using graphs and tables, rather than handing the
whole analysis over to a number cruncher. Professional statisticians are best used to
answer complex questions, but you should be able to do the simple statistics yourself,
perhaps guided by a statistician. Not being able to do any statistics means that you lost
contact with your data at the vital point when it is being investigated for patterns,
anticipated and unanticipated.<br>
What are they funding this year? This sounds like a cynical point, but if there are funds
available for research in specific areas, make use of them. What charities are there who
might be interested in your research area? Talk to colleagues; there is often no single
listing of available research sponsors, and you have to rely on the grapevine.</p>

<p>2. What are the specific resources that you could use as the basis for a project?</p>

<p>2.1 Do you have access to information already collected which could be the basis for a
research project?</p>

<p>This information could have been collected as routine clinical information. Although
you probably cannot do a research project solely on the contents of patients' charts,
routinely collected information may allow you to<br>
- Identify patient groups that are interesting to study (and figure out if there are
enough of them to be worth studying!)<br>
- Identify controls<br>
- Add already-collected clinical information to the data that you will collect in the
course of your project.</p>

<p>Information may also be available as an offshoot of another research project. You may
liaise with another research project and<br>
- study a subgroup of their patients in more detail<br>
- follow up a previously-studied group<br>
- add a sub-study of your own to a study that is being planned or, not so easy, ongoing. </p>

<p>It is a good idea to talk to people who are doing research in the setting in which you
work. They will be able to spot potential difficulties in proposals, and may also have
useful ideas as to what they would do if they had access to your facilities. </p>

<p>POTENTIAL PROJECTS</p>

<p>Now all you need to do is to get an idea for a project which will be realistic, given
the resources available to you. This is often a stumbling block. I had one person come
into the office to discuss a research project with me. 'I have 24 patients with rapid
cycling mood disorder' he said. And stopped, waiting for me to say something. The trouble
is that 24 patients with rapid cycling mood disorder is no more a research project than 24
trout in a shoebox. What you need to ask yourself is 'what do we not know about rapid
cycling mood disorder'? </p>

<p>One very important piece of advice that recurred frequently in the edstat-l discussion
was the need to develop many ideas simultaneously. Christie Brown, Assistant Professor of
Marketing at University of Michigan Business School tells her students to imagine that
inside them they have a large basket of research ideas, some better than others: 'I point
students toward Donald Campbell's work on creativity. Campbell suggests one secret to
generating better ideas lies in the QUANTITY of ideas generated. In other words you stand
the best chance of pulling an idea from the &quot;high&quot; end of your good-idea basket
if you make a lot of draws.' (Campbell, Donald T. &quot;Blind variation and selective
retentions in creative thought as in other knowledge processes.&quot; Psychological
Review. 1960;67:380-400.)</p>

<p>Don't focus prematurely on a single idea. Develop a few together. It's like the process
of conception: the chances of a child resulting from a single act of sexual intercourse
are small. But the chances of a child not resulting from regular sexual intercourse are
likewise small. Carry a notebook and write down every idea that you get, good or bad. You
will learn from thinking about why the bad ones are bad as well as from why the good ones
are good. Christie Brown again: 'Write down everything. Do not self-censor. Keep a log of
your baby-ideas in case they end up being worth pursuing. Get in the habit of generating
at least one idea based on everything you read in your domain and even out of it. Bob
Frick, a cognitive scientist, actually forces students to develop a number of research
ideas as a learning exercise. 'The assignment was to come up with three
&quot;kernels&quot;, and the students had about a month to do it. The notion was that they
were supposed to find some original idea they had. It usually ended up being an original
observation. Original to them -- it didn't have to be original to the field of psychology.
Their original idea would then be a kernel that could be developed into an experiment.
Most people have these, but they don't pay attention.'</p>

<p>Much of the discussion on edstat-l centred around where ideas for research projects
come from. The sources of ideas divide into two: - Replicating/extending the work of
others<br>
- Doing something original.</p>

<p>I'll take the easy one first!</p>

<p>EXTENDING IDEAS OF OTHERS</p>

<p>Repeating research that has been done by others doesn't sound like task, but there are
seal important reasons why it needs to be done, and there are some other benefits too. The
reasons why research needs to be replicated include:</p>

<p>Local research is needed to make sure that findings from other countries apply locally.
Indeed, basic research is constantly needed to monitor local health needs and to evaluate
the services being delivered. Is the problem the same here? For instance, research has
shown that liaison psychiatry in Ireland sees a very different spectrum of morbidity than
its counterpart in the US. Planning services using US models is inappropriate. If you
suspect that the service in which you work sees a spectrum of patients or problems that is
different to what you would expect, research this. It can lead to a better understanding
of the health service needs in your service.<br>
Do the strategies worked out elsewhere apply? Many treatments and interventions have been
researched in settings that may be quite different to your own. You might well ask if they
are best for your setting.</p>

<p>1 All research needs extension to new contexts and development along an obvious line<br>
- Clinical trials are often done on homogeneous, idealised patient groups; they need
extension to realistic groups such as those with comorbidity, or beyond the age range of
the original research. Think of ++Treatment of hypertension in the elderly. This is a
classic case where treatment was wrong for many years because it was based on the results
of studies of younger patients.<br>
++Use of treatments in neonates that have only been studied in older children or adults.
This example has become topical recently, as paediatricians have realised that very young
children are often excluded from treatment trials, yet the treatments end up being used to
treat them, ++Many treatments are evaluated on patients who have 'pure' diagnoses, while
they are frequently applied to people who have more than one disorder. </p>

<p>2 Factors which have been identified in a disease may be present in other similar
diseases.<br>
- Since its role in peptic ulcer disease was uncovered, H pylori has been investigated for
many other unsolved crimes. Is it responsible for the digestive symptoms some pregnant
women experience? Is it linked to cancers? Yes, there is a feeling of a bandwagon rolling
along, but someone has to check out these questions.</p>

<p>3 You may spot an explanation which the original study failed to identify and test.This
is, of course, classic 'stroke-of-genius' research. Just remember, though, that the
explanations that are most often overlooked are the commonest, most familiar things. </p>

<p>4 You may not believe a piece of research.<br>
Not all research is good research. I have, several times, replicated and extended research
because I didn't believe it. Incredible research deserves to be replicated. If you confirm
the original findings, you have helped to overcome the resistance that they will find in
being accepted. If you fail to confirm the findings, this in itself is interesting. Though
try to make sure that the original author isn't asked to review your paper! </p>

<p>Even doing a straightforward replication of a previous study can be a very worthwhile
exercise. As a first project, it means that you already have a 'canned' methodology, and
you will learn a lot about running, analysing and presenting research, But there are often
surprises too. Chris Zorn of Emory University wrote: 'As a social scientist responsible
for training grad students in statistics, one thing that I've always found useful is
replications While the main reason I use replications is to teach students statistics
and/or software, these exercises often prompt them to extend the work they are
replicating. These can range from the simple (e.g. testing for relationships in the data
that the original investigators didn't look for) to the very involved. The result is often
interesting, if a bit derivative, research projects, some of which have led to PhD theses,
etc.' Andersson Roland puts it simply: &quot;Dig where you stand&quot;. That is, make use
of all the data that is already at hand and that nobody had time to analyse. Almost always
there will be unexpected or unknown patterns in these data that can be detected if you
analyse them with an open mind. You do not always need to have an research idea ready when
you start. They will come up when you try to formulate an explanation for the patterns
that you find in your data.'</p>

<p>Alex Heath, an economist from Australia, wrote: 'A good way to get started thinking
about research questions for me is to find things which have been done overseas (usually
the US or the UK) and adapt them to Australian data. I find that once you start
replicating things you find interesting twists and turns which allow you to say something
completely new.'</p>

<p>Although I have replicated several studies because I didn't believe them, this probably
isn't the best spirit in which to replicate. But neither should you simply accept the
original research as scripture. Paul Velleman, the person responsible for the DataDesk
statistical package and ActivStats, a statistical teaching package, wrote in praise of an
attitude of well-informed skepticism: 'This misses the most important part of the process
-- an abiding skepticism. You must know your science before you can be intelligently
skeptical about it, but just because you know what is common wisdom doesn't mean you
should believe it. Indeed, if science is to progress, you must maintain a willingness to
disbelieve. </p>

<p>You don't do research by replicating previous results but by doubting them.'</p>

<p>Dennis Roberts, responding to this, said 'a good replication study does not have to be
done BECAUSE one doubts them but rather, to bolster the case that the research findings
made ... ' I think that he and Paul really just differ in emphasis, with Dennis arguing
that 'replication is very valuable ... we don't do enough of it ... ' while Paul cautions
against literal-minded repetition. I think everyone would agree that the scientific idea
of replication is doing something more intelligent than just looking for what the other
guys already saw. Paul makes the point, too, that it is hard to sit down and work
carefully through a set of data without coming up with at least one pattern that needs
further <br>
investigation. You may start by replicating a study, but this is almost guaranteed to act
as a springboard to innovative questions of your own. </p>

<p>GETTING A RESEARCH IDEA BY READING PAPERS.</p>

<p>You can simply bury yourself in the library with a whole year's worth of your favourite
journal and, starting from the most recent issue, use a series of filters to identify
studies that you would be interested in and capable of extending. Even when I'm not in
need of a research project, I often graze my way through a small stack of journals,
picking up an interesting methodological approach here, or a useful measurement technique
there. Many of my more prolific colleagues do this a lot. One, in particular, seems able
to rummage out a half-a-dozen relevant journal articles from her shelves on any topic in
about five minutes. <br>
If I am looking for a potential project, I look at each article in turn and ask:<br>
- Does the title sound interesting? If so, look at the abstract. There is little point in
taking on a research project that doesn't sound interesting. It will be a lot of work, so
it will have to hold your attention.<br>
- Can I extend this study to a relevant patient group? Think about the sorts of patients
you have access to--would it be interesting to try this on them?<br>
- Can I extend the methods by assessing something not assessed in the original paper, or
increasing quality of assessment? Remember that you are one of your own best research
resources. Can you refine the study design by substituting a personal interview or a
medical examination. for a self-administered questionnaire?<br>
- Read the end of the discussion to see if the authors identify areas for future research.
Usually the researchers will make a big play to inflate the importance of their area of
interest, and do a paragraph of 'we-simply-must-know' stuff. They are usually either
working on this themselves or they have applied for a grant already, so if you decide to
follow up their suggestion, move fast. <br>
- If you find that an article catches your attention as a possible project, do a
literature search to get a feel for the area (and look carefully through the references in
the original article, of course; aside from identifying useful articles to read, you will
get an idea of the sorts of journals that might take your paper, and you can target it
accordingly).<br>
- Contact the authors. Authors love to hear from people who think that what they are
researching is interesting. They often provide advice, access to unpublished manuscripts,
free consultation time simply because that's the way research works. Be prepared to do the
same in your turn! The easiest way to contact the authors is get an email address. Search
the website of their institution if the article doesn't have an email address, or try
using an email search engine on the internet to find them. People reply faster to email,
and you can bombard them with small queries which would be irritating in letters. And, of
course, keep them in touch with your work. They may be a great help when it comes to
analysing and writing up.<br>
- Finally, you should also think about plundering the abstracts from conferences. There
may well be something there, and the work will be newer than published articles. If you
are actually at a conference, seek out the people who are doing research that would
interest you. Over coffee you can usually get ideas for several projects from them. One
favourite ploy I use is to ask them how they would do their research if they could start
all over again, knowing what they know now.</p>

<p>GETTING YOUR OWN IDEAS. </p>

<p>This is an even harder subject to write about than extending and developing the ideas
of others. (Did I say plagiarising? -- Never!). The secret seems to be keeping your eyes
and ears open all the time. The observation doesn't have to be complicated. On the
contrary, spotting an obvious question in an everyday event often has greater potential.
Jack Schnell of Department of Economics at the University of Alabama in Huntsville
remembers simple advice he got as a student: 'look out of the window', meaning 'pay
attention to what is happening out there in the world, look for issues that are ripe for
investigation. And since that time I have tried to do just that. For me, this has been
more intellectually sustaining than, say, combing through some literature in the hopes of
seeing a useful extension.'</p>

<p>A simple observation can spark off a whole train of ideas. Roland Andersson, of the
Department of Surgery in Joenkoeping, Sweden, said 'For me it started like this: I
observed that we had had 12 patients with appendicitis during one week. The following
weeks we had only one or two. I wondered: &quot;Had we had an epidemic of
appendicitis?&quot;. I happened to know about Knox space-time analysis and I started off
from there and finally have written a thesis about &quot;Appendicitis - epidemiology and
diagnosis&quot;. Lots of new questions arise and I am now involved in a (as it seems)
never ending project about aspects of appendicitis.' (And please, don't worry if you have
no idea what Knox space-time analysis is; the important point is that Roland brought
together a specialised theoretical framework which he already knew and a common everyday
observation. In other words, he applied the theory he knew to the world outside the
window.)</p>

<p>But what frame of mind, what view of the world do you need in order to have productive
research ideas? A lot of discussion focussed on this question. At one extreme was Robert
Hamer, who very much doubted whether you could teach anyone how to look at the world in a
questioning manner. I don't think that this is true, though. We are brought up in a way
that does not encourage us to question the explanations we are given for things. Don't
forget that all children are hungry to find things out, to know why things are so. This
voice of hunger for knowledge and delight in figuring things out is much smaller and more
timid by the time we have grown up, but with patience it can be called back. It takes time
to rid ourselves of this learned uncuriuosity. The trick is doing what children do: asking
lots of questions and teasing out the logical consequences of the answers. Paul Velleman
again: Dennis is right that the problem is nudging the mind. We need to start that process
in childhood. We must cultivate in our children and our students a broad-based skepticism
coupled with a sense that there *is* order in the universe.'</p>

<p>These are the sorts of questions that scientists and other children ask. </p>

<p>How does this work?<br>
What is the proposed biological explanation for the thing I am looking at? How do we know?
Is there another possible explanation? puts it like this; one must maintain an active and
abiding skepticism about the explanations and models that have been proposed in science.
Skepticism, which Paul Velleman identifies as a key attitude, doesn't involve simple
disbelief, but rather being able to entertain a number of different explanations at once.
This struck a chord with Robert Knodt: 'After being involved with masters and doctoral
students for over thirty-years and looking back for an answer to the original post, I find
that the statement above applied to over 90% of those I helped... The first person I
worked with was bothered by a statement in a 10th grade Biology book which said that trees
were pruned in the fall in order to make them fill out areas and become more symmetrical.
This still bothered him eight years later. He finally did is work on 'wound' hormones in
plants. </p>

<p>Says who?<br>
Many pieces of medical knowledge are folkloric, and the evidence is slender. In particular<br>
- Clinical signs and diagnostic tests--are they really reliable and valid? The apex beat,
for instance, is taught as a religion in some cardiology departments. Research into the
repeatability of this clinical sign shows that it is hard for two observers to locate it
in the same patient, much less in the same place.<br>
- Factors are supposed to be associated with prognosis or diagnosis: where's the evidence?
Women with small feet, for instance, are supposed to be at higher risk of caesarian
section because of the baby's head being too big for the pelvis. But this assertion rests
on a couple of small and doubtful studies. Better research (already done--sorry!) has
shown that this is just a medical myth.<br>
- Rituals of patient management (surgical masks, changing wound dressings) may have no
evidence to support their usefulness. </p>

<p>I don't believe that!<br>
Always trust your disbelief. Often a trip to the library will put your mind at rest, but
think about<br>
- Alternative explanations for things you have been told<br>
- Your feeling that what you see in your own practice is not what you have been told you
will see</p>

<p>Why are we doing this?<br>
At every point in clinical practice there are decision forks. Some may be invisible (we
always do X when Y happens) but there are the most interesting! For example<br>
- What is the most informative sequence of diagnostic tests?<br>
- What are the treatment options at a given moment? How do we decide between them?</p>

<p>Why are they both right?<br>
Some disagreements in the literature are because no-one has yet spotted the reason why two
different sets of investigators should have observed data that were seemingly
contradictory.</p>

<p>Can we learn from the abnormal?<br>
We learn once from describing the normal--normal course of disease, normal range of
variation etc. We learn a second time by examining cases that do not fit the general
picture.<br>
- Rare, pathological conditions can give us an insight into how more subtle, commonplace
processes work.<br>
- Congenital homocysteinemia and CHD led to the investigation of homocysteine in CHD in
'normal' people<br>
- Research into doctor-patient interactions in hypochondriasis gave leads for
investigating health anxiety as a dynamic in these interactions in normal patients.</p>

<p>I don't know where ideas come from, but I do know that you get more ideas if you try to
remember everything that happens that doesn't have a good explanation. I carry a little
black notebook which can simply be used to note phone numbers and things I have to buy
next time I go shopping, but it also means that I have a way of writing down an idea the
instant I spot something interesting. </p>

<p>The last thing I want to say is based on my experiences teaching music to adolescents,
as much as teaching research methods to medical students. The biggest obstacle you
encounter is a feeling that you can't do this; that you aren't the sort of person who can
sing, or make interesting observations or pose original questions. Just remember: this is
what you did as a child, before you were taught any different. So you already know how to
do this; just think of yourself as a little rusty.</p>
