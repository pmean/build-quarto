<p><strong>How to randomize (August 18, 1999) </strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/steps-in-randomization/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dear Professor Mean, I need to randomize the order in which I give 
 treatments and controls in my research study, but I don't know how to 
 randomize. Can you show me what to do? -- Baffled Beth</em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Baffled,</font></p>
<p>Here's a lightbulb randomization joke: <em>take to in How many a screw does 
   statisticians it lightbulb?</em></p>
<p>There are also two quotes that are relevant here: &quot;<em>Random selection is 
  too important to be left to chance</em>&quot; and &quot;<em>Random is not haphazard</em>&quot;. 
  The latter quote can be found in Statistically Speaking. A Dictionary of 
  Quotations by C.G. Gaither and A.E. Cavazos-Gaither.</p>
<p><strong>Short answer</strong></p>
<p>The simplest way to randomize is to</p>
<ol>
  <li>list your treatments and controls in a systematic order, </li>
  <li>attach a random number to each row, and </li>
  <li>sort by the random number.</li>
</ol>
<p>This works for simple randomization, block randomization, and randomization 
   in a cross-over design.</p>
<p><strong>Why randomization is important.</strong></p>
<p>I'm glad that you are interested in randomization. Some people think it is 
   fine just to alternate regularly between treatment and control. But there are 
   two problems with this. </p>
<p>First, if you've watched plants grow in a garden, you will notice that they 
   tend to have a large-small-large-small pattern, especially if they are 
   planted too tightly together. The plants are competing for resources. If one 
   plant gets a small lead, its increased consumption will make the plants on 
   either side of it grow more slowly. If you alternated between treatment and 
   control in this garden, you would notice a difference that is entirely 
   independent of the treatment.</p>
<p>This same sort of large-small pattern can occur in medical situations. For 
   example, if a doctor spends too much time with his/her first patient, it 
   increases the probability that the next patient will get less time (in order 
   to keep things on schedule). </p>
<p>A second problem with alternating is that many studies are blinded. An 
   alternating schedule may make it easy for someone to guess what patients get 
   what treatment, ruining the blinding. </p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Let me show you this in Excel, but the general method works well for any 
   program that can generate random numbers. Suppose we have a study with twelve 
   patients, six treatment and six control. List C and T alternating down in the 
   first twelve rows of the first column of the spreadsheet. In the second 
   column, place the RAND() function in each of the first twelve rows. Here is 
   what you have:</p>
<p>
  <img src="../00/Images/random31.gif" alt="Excel table, unsorted" WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="278"></p>
<p>Your random numbers will be different than these. Otherwise, they wouldn't 
   be random now, would they?</p>
<p>To randomize, sort the data by the second column. Notice that the 
   systematic order of the first column has been scrambled.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../00/Images/random32.gif" alt="Excel table, sorted" WIDTH="102" HEIGHT="278"></p>
<p>By the way, when you try this on your spreadsheet, you will notice that 
   after the sort, the random numbers are recalculated. This seems a bit 
   disconcerting, since the sorted numbers randomly change to different (and 
   unsorted) values. You had to look really, really fast to see the sorted 
   numbers. </p>
<p>When I work out these examples, I freeze the random numbers by pasting 
   their values only into a third column (select EDIT | PASTE SPECIAL) and then 
   deleting the second column. That's why the random numbers in my example 
   stayed sorted. It doesn't make much difference, though, what happens with the 
   second column; it's the first column we are interested in. </p>
<p><strong>What is block randomization?</strong></p>
<p>If there is the possibility that the experiment will not reach your target 
   sample size, then sometimes randomization can leave an imbalance due to the 
   (bad) luck of the draw. For example, if the previous experiment ended 
   halfway, we would have had four treatment patients and only two controls. 
   This is not too terrible, but for a larger sample, the discrepancies can get 
   quite problematic. </p>
<p>A solution to this problem is to divide your study up into blocks and then 
   randomize within each block. If the study ends at a block boundary, then you 
   are guaranteed to have perfect balance between treatments and controls. If a 
   study ends in the middle of a block, there might be some imbalance, but 
   probably much less than with regular randomization. </p>
<p>In Excel, we would arrange the T and C values systematically and then add a 
   column with a block number. The third column would be our random numbers. 
   Here is what it would look like.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../00/Images/random33.gif" alt="Excel table, unsorted" WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="278"></p>
<p>Now we sort the numbers, by block and by random number within block.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../00/Images/random34.gif" alt="Excel table, sorted" WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="278"></p>
<p>Notice that the first block has the order TCTC, the second has CTCT, and 
   the third has CCTT. </p>
<p><strong>How do I randomize in a matched pairs study?</strong></p>
<p>You can randomize a matched pairs study the same way as with block 
   randomization. In a matched study, every patient gets both the treatment and 
   the control (separated by enough time so that the effect of one cannot carry 
   over into the other). It is important to randomize the order in which the 
   patients get the treatment and the control. </p>
<p>The easy way to do this is to allocate two rows for each patient and label 
   the rows T and C in a systematic order. Add random numbers and then sort 
   within each patient. </p>
<p>Here's an a example of how we would set up a matched pairs example for six 
   patients.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../00/Images/random35.gif" alt="Excel table, unsorted" WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="278"></p>
<p>Sort the data by patient and by random number within each patient. </p>
<p>
  <img src="../00/Images/random36.gif" alt="Excel table, sorted" WIDTH="134" HEIGHT="278"></p>
<p>Notice that patients 1,3, and 4 get the control first and patients 2, 5, 
   and 6 get the treatment first. </p>
<p><b>Assigning random id numbers for anonymization</b></p>
<p>Suppose you want to create an identification code that is effectively 
   random. You want to avoid medical record numbers because they would 
   compromise security. There are several approaches that work. A simple 
   approach is to list the numbers 1001, 1002, etc., but this gives a hint as to 
   when the subject joined the study. A better approach is to list those numbers 
   and then sort them in a random order. These numbers can then be 
   cut-and-pasted next to the medical record numbers.</p>
<p>Here's the medical record number, a sequential ID, and a column of random 
   numbers.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../00/Images/random1.gif"></p>
<p>Sort the last two columns only to get a shuffled list of IDs.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../00/Images/random2.gif"></p>
<p>Keep this list in a secure location. Use only the ID column when sending 
   your data out beyond the hospital. This approach protects the privacy of 
   individual subjects.</p>
<p>Whenever you are concerned about privacy in a research study, it is a good 
   idea to discuss your concerns with your IRB (Institutional Review Board).</p>
<p><b>Update</b></p>
<p>In an August 10, 2005 <a href="../08/weblog.asp">weblog</a> entry, I discuss 
   how the use of randbetween() function leads to problems with a random amount 
   of imbalance being created. For example, the spreadsheet I was given had 223 
   people randomized to the first group and only 177 randomized to the second 
   group. This is well within sampling error, but still leads to a slight 
   inefficiency in the analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Baffled Beth does not know <strong>how to properly randomize subjects for 
   her research study</strong>. Professor Mean explains how randomization 
   differs from allocating the treatment and control in an alternative fashion. 
   He shows a <strong>simple approach for randomization</strong>, which involves
</p>
<ol>
  <li>arranging your treatments in a systematic order,</li>
  <li>attaching a column of random number to this list, and </li>
  <li>sorting by the random number column.</li>
</ol>
<p>He then shows examples for s<strong>imple randomization, block 
   randomization, and randomization in a matched pairs study</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Further Reading</strong></p>
<p>There's an interesting two page article in the British Medical Journal on 
   randomisation (notice the alternate spelling. I feel so intellectual when I 
   replace all my z's with s's.)</p>
