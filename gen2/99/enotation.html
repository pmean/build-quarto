<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, In my regression 
 output, I saw that following value: -2.384E-03. What does this E notation mean?</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Think of the &quot;E&quot; as short for extreme. Some 
  numbers are very small, such as</font></p>
<p>0.0000000000000000000000016727</p>
<p>the weight of a proton in grams. Other numbers are
  <font face="Times New Roman">very large, such as</font></p>
<p>5,913,520,000</p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">the number of kilometers from the Sun to 
  Pluto. In both cases it is difficult for a computer to display this number in 
  a fixed amount of space. We can save some space by representing the number as 
  a value between 1 and 10 times a power of ten. For example, the two numbers 
  listed above could be represented as 1.6727*10^-24 and 5.91352*10^9.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The &quot;E&quot; is shorthand for multiply the number 
  on the left by 10 raised to the power of the number on the right. We refer to 
  this as scientific notation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">The value following the E tells you how many 
  decimal places to shift your answer. If the value is negative, shift to the 
  left. If the value is positive, shift to the right. So, the value -2.384E-03 
  means to shift the decimal three places to the left. When we do this, we get</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">-0.002384</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Let's suppose that SPSS displayed a very large 
  number as 3.452E6. We would move the decimal 6 places to the right to get</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">3,452,000</font></p>
