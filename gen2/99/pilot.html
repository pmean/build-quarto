<p><b>Pilot study (created 1999-09-03, updated 2010-07-08)</b>.</p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/steps-in-pilot-study/">new website</a>.</p>

<p>This is an update of a webpage originally published at 
www.childrens-mercy.org/stats/plan/pilot.asp, but which is no longer available there.</p>
<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, I am proposing a 
 research study that will examine a complex intervention of diet, exercise, and 
 behavioral modification for some of my pediatric patients who need to lose 
 weight. I want to collect some data from a pilot study before I start the 
 research study. How do I describe the pilot study in my protocol? -- 
 Sophisticated Sarah</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Sophisticated, That reminds me of a cute joke. How many 
   statisticians does it take to light a gas stove? I don't know because we 
   haven't run the pilot study yet.</font></p>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Short answer</font></b>. <font face="Times New Roman">Think of the pilot study as a model of your 
   full research study, but on a smaller scale. </font><font face="Times New Roman">Run the pilot study for a 
   briefer time frame and/or on fewer subjects. Focus the pilot study on those 
aspects of your full study that are novel, untested, complex, or innovative.</font></p>
<p>Do you remember all the controversy in Florida last year after the 
   presidential election? We could have avoided a few of these problems if 
 someone had run a pilot study on that butterfly ballot in Palm Beach County.</p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">It helps if you can clarify the reasons that 
   you want a pilot study. These reasons can be loosely classified into two 
   categories</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">To obtain data to help you plan the full 
    study</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">To see where &quot;Murphy's Law&quot; will strike</font></li>
</ul>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman">There are other reasons to run a pilot study. 
   A pilot study helps everyone on your research team get familiar with the 
   procedures in your protocol. A pilot study can also help you decide between 
   two competing approaches (e.g., collecting data in an interview versus using 
   a self-administered survey).</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Data for planning</strong></font>. <font face="Times New Roman">Perhaps the most critical piece of 
  data from a pilot study is the standard deviation of your outcome measure. 
  You cannot select an appropriate sample size for your study without knowing 
this value. If your outcome measure is used very commonly, 
   then you may already have an idea what your standard deviation is. Just look 
   at some of the papers that you cited in your literature review. It takes a 
   bit of hunting sometimes, but usually you can find some estimate of 
   variation, such as a standard error, coefficient of variation, or confidence 
</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Whether you need to estimate the standard 
   deviation in a pilot study depends on the degree of uniqueness and innovation 
   in your experiment. Every experiment is unique, of course, but examine 
   whether the use of this outcome measure has little or no precedent. Also 
   examine how much different your subject population is. An outcome measure 
   that has only been used in adults, for example, may make it more important 
 for you to get pilot data for your pediatric study.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>If your outcome measure is the 
   probability of some event, then your sample size depends on how often the 
   event occurs in your control population</strong>. You can use a pilot study 
   to estimate this probability, but usually you can get a pretty good estimate 
   of probabilities from previous research.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>You should also try to estimate 
   participation rates with your pilot study</strong>. How many people do you 
   encounter per month that are eligible for your study? How many agree to 
   participate? How many drop out in the middle of the study?</font></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Finally, information from the pilot 
   will help you estimate resource requirements</strong>. How much time do you 
   spend per subject? How much money do you spend per subject? Both pieces of 
   information are critical for preparing the budget for your full study.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Murphy's Law</font></b>. <font face="Times New Roman">Murphy's Law says that anything that can go 
   wrong, will go wrong. The reason you run a pilot study is to ensure that 
   the things that do go wrong, go wrong during the pilot study so you can fix 
them before you start the full study.</font> <font face="Times New Roman">It's impossible to list all ways that a study 
could go wrong, but here are some areas that you should focus on.</font></p>
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Recruitment and retention problems</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">.
 </font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Do you get the types of subjects that you 
    think you will get?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Are important segments of your population 
    being left out?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Do a lot of people turn down the 
    opportunity to participate in your study?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Do a lot of people fail to finish your 
    study?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Do a lot of people fail to comply with your 
    protocol requirements?</font></b></li>
  </ul>
  
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Ambiguous situations</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Is it obvious who meets and who does not 
    meet the eligibility requirements?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Do your subjects provide no answer, 
    multiple answers, qualified answers, or unanticipated answers to your 
    survey?</font></b></li>
  </ul>
 
<p> <b><font face="Times New Roman">Time and resource problems</font></b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Does it take too long for your subjects to 
    fill out all the survey forms?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Will the study participants overload your 
    phone lines or overflow your waiting room?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">How much time does it take to mail out a 
    thousand surveys, and can your tongue lick that many stamps in one day?</font></b></li>
  </ul>
  
<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Machinery problems</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Is the equipment readily available when and 
    where you need it?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">What happens when it breaks down or gets 
    stolen?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">If the machine produces a stream of 
    electronic data, can your computer software read and understand this data?</font></li>
  </ul>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Data management problems</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">.</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Is there enough room on the data collection 
    form for all of the data you receive?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Do you have any problems entering your data 
    into the computer?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Can you match data that comes in from 
    different sources?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Were any important data values forgotten 
    about?</font></b></li>
    <li>Does your data show too much or too little variability?</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>Uninformative data</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Are most of your lab results are below the 
    limit of detection?</font></li>
    <li><font face="Times New Roman">Does everybody gives the identical answer 
    to a survey question?</font></li>
  </ul>

<p><b><font face="Times New Roman">Blind spots and oversights</font></b><font face="Times New Roman">. Something will 
   happen during your pilot study and you'll say &quot;I never thought about that!&quot; 
   Better to have this oversight now than during the full study. Although you 
   can and should show ask your colleagues whether there is there anything you 
   overlooked in your protocol, it's still a good idea to run a pilot study. 
   After all, your colleagues may have the same blind spots that you do.</font></b></p>
<p><b>Other considerations for a pilot study</b></p>
  <p><font face="Times New Roman"><b>Don't worry about the representativeness of 
   your pilot subjects</b>, unless you plan to include them in the total sample, 
   or if the sampling procedure itself is complex and innovative. Just make sure 
   that your pilot subjects cover the entire range of subjects in your full 
   study. So if you plan to study this intervention in children ages 6-14, make 
   sure that you have some 6 year olds and some 14 year olds in your pilot study 
   as well as a bunch in between.</font></p>
  <p>Also, <b>don't confuse a pilot study with an exploratory study</b>. An 
   exploratory study will typically try to generate hypotheses for further 
   research. Unlike a pilot study, <b>an exploratory study can stand on its own</b>. 
   Furthermore, you should look for some justification of the sample size in an 
   exploratory study. Since such a study does not have any pre-specified 
   hypotheses, you justify the sample size by showing that some of the estimates 
   produced by the study have reasonable precision.</p>
  <p>There is <b>no explicit justification of the sample size for a pilot study</b>. 
   It depends a lot on the complexity of the study. Be sure though, that you 
   aren't just calling their research a pilot study just to get out of having to 
   justify the sample size.</p>
  <p>If you are <b>presenting a pilot study to the IRB</b>, I encourage you to
   <b>cite the type of information that the pilot will provide</b>. Also, please 
   be sure to <b>place the pilot study in the context of the full-blown study</b>. 
   You personally may not be the one who would conduct that full-blown study, 
   but you still need to provide that context.</p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Summary</font></strong></p>
  <p>A pilot study is a model of your full research study but on a smaller 
   scale. The pilot study helps by <strong>providing data needed to plan the 
   larger study</strong> and by <strong>identifying areas where Murphy's Law 
   will strike</strong>.</p>

  <p>The Lancaster et al publication is an excellent resource. I wrote a
   <a href="../04/PilotStudy.asp">brief summary of this article</a> for 
   my weblog. Goodman et al and Omenn et al are nice 
   published examples of pilot studies. Wittes et al is an argument in favor of 
   including pilot data in the full research study.</p>
