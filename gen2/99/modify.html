<p><strong>Modifying SPSS data (created 1999-09-18)</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/modifying-spss-data/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, Before I start my data 
 analysis, I need to modify some of the data in my SPSS data set. I don't want 
 to re-type every number by hand. Is there a faster way to do this? -- Impatient 
 Pam</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Impatient</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You should really be more patient. The best 
  strategy is to compute all of your statistics and then change the data if you 
  don't like what you see.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">No, no, I'm just kidding. I'm sure you're the 
  last person who would want to cheat like this. There are many legitimate 
  reasons for changing your data, of course. One is to convert to a different 
  unit of measurement. Another is to combine categories together. <strong>
  Various procedures for changing your data appear under the TRANSFORM menu in 
  SPSS</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Select the COMPUTE submenu if you want 
  to modify a continuous variable</strong>. Converting to a different unit of 
  measurement is one example. You would also use COMPUTE if you wanted to 
  calculate a ratio of two variables.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Select the RECODE submenu if you want 
  to modify a categorical variable</strong>. Combining some of the category 
  levels is one example. Also use RECODE if you want to renumber your category 
  levels.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">More details</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>To convert a continuous variable, you 
  need to specify the name of the new variable and the formula for the 
  conversion</strong>. Select TRANSFORM | COMPUTE from the menu, to get the 
  COMPUTE VARIABLE dialog box. This box has entry fields for the TARGET 
  VARIABLE and for the NUMERIC EXPRESSION. You would type in the name of the 
  new variable in the first field and then type an algebraic formula in the 
  second field. SPSS thoughtfully provides you with lists of the current 
  variables and all of the mathematical functions to save you a bit of typing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">For example, if you were converting 
  temperature scales, the two fields might contain temp_c and 5/9*(temp_f-32), 
  respectively. You have to be careful about temperature measurements. I 
  visited Toronto in 1994, and it was so far north that even in August, the 
  temperature never got above 35 degrees.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>Be sure that you know the range of 
  possible values for any variables that you transform</strong>. If you define 
  a formula with division and some of your denominators are zero, or if you 
  define a formula using square roots and some of your data is negative, SPSS 
  will complain and insert missing values into the offending spots in your new 
  variable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman"><strong>To convert a categorical variable, you 
  must specify a list of all the possible current values and what you want to 
  covert each value into.</strong> This can be tedious. No one ever claimed 
  that data management was fun. It's good form to account for every possible 
  category when using RECODE. Using ranges and/or the ALL OTHER VALUES option 
  will help. If you fail to specify a category, SPSS will assume that you want 
  to use the same category code in your new variable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When you select TRANSFORM | RECODE you have 
  the choice of recoding INTO SAME VARIABLES or INTO DIFFERENT VARIABLES. The 
  folks who like to go bungee jumping without checking the length of the bungee 
  cord usually select the first option. <strong>Unless you want to make 
    permanent and irreversible changes to your data set, always recode into 
    different variables.</strong></font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Also you should <strong>plan for how you want 
  missing values to be handled</strong>. Sometimes you might want to convert 
  missing values into a special category or you might want to convert a special 
  category to missing. You can choose instead to work with missing values when 
  you document your variables (by selecting DATA | DEFINE VARIABLE from the 
  menu or by double clicking on column heading).</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Example</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">In a study of breast feeding, one of the 
  variables measures birth weight in kilograms. Suppose we needed to <strong>
  convert this column of data into grams</strong>. This would simply involve 
  mulitplying by 1000.</font></p>
<p><img src="../02/images/modify01.gif" alt="Profm10.bmp (242410 bytes)"></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We would select TRANSFORM | COMPUTE from the 
  menu and fill in the dialog box as shown above. We could then click on the 
  TYPE&amp;LABEL button if we wanted to add documentation for this new variable.</font></p>
<p>Another variable in this data set is breast feeding status at discharge. 
   This is a categorical variable with four levels, 1=Exclusive, 2=Partial, 
   3=Supplement, 4=None. We want to estimate the probability of exclusive breast 
   feeding at discharge in a logistic regression model. Since a logistic model 
   requires that the dependent variable have only two levels, we need to <strong>
   combine category levels 2, 3, and 4 into a single new category level</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="../02/images/modify02.gif" alt="Profm11.bmp (221710 bytes)"></p>
<p>We would start by selecting TRANSFORM | RECODE from the menu. In the first 
   dialog box, we would select the original variable (bw0) and provide a name 
   (excl0) and label (Exclusive breast feeding status at discharge) for the new 
   variable. This produces a dialog box that looks like the above.</p>
<p><img src="../02/images/modify03.gif" alt="Profm12.bmp (209006 bytes)"></p>
<p>Then we would click on the OLD AND NEW VALUES button to define what 
   categories we want to recode. The value of 1 (exclusive) will stay the same, 
   and the values of 2 through 4 (partial, supplement, and none) will change to 
   0. We will convert any other values to missing. The above figure shows what 
   the second dialog box would look like when we are done.</p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Summary</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">You can find modifications for SPSS data under 
  the TRANSFORM menu. Select the COMPUTE submenu if you want to modify a 
  continuous variable. Select the RECODE submenu if you want to modify a 
  categorical variable.</font></p>
