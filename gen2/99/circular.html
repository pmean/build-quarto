<p><b>Circular data models (no date)</b> [incomplete]</p>

<blockquote>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-after: avoid">When your data has a 
   cyclic or circular component, then the use of basic trigonometry can provide 
   a statistical model that allows for cyclic effect. Examples of cyclic 
   components are time of the day and wind direction.</p>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-after: avoid">The unique feature is 
   that data at opposite ends of the interval are actually close to one another. 
   For example, wind direction could be recorded as a number between 0 and 360, 
   with 0 representing north, 90 representing east, 180 representing south, and 
   270 representing west. Notice that with this variable, winds at 10 and 350 
   are very close. Time of the day could be represented by values 00:00 for 
   midnight, 12:00 for noon and 23:59 for one minute before midnight.</p>
  <p STYLE="margin-bottom: 0cm; page-break-after: avoid">An average for cyclic 
   data is pretty much useless whenever you have data at the extremes. For 
   example, suppose you have a teenage child who is supposed to be home before 
   10pm (2200). The first two evenings, he returns at 11pm (2300) and at 1am 
   (0100). Although both times are beyond the curfew, the average return time, 
   1200, is at noon!</p>
