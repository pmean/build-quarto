<p><strong>Design of microarray experiments (no date)</strong></p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/micro-array-design/">new website</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are a variety of research designs that you can use in a microarray 
experiment.</p>

<p><b>Designs for cDNA arrays</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Loop designs [explain]</p>
  <p>A dye swap design use the treated DNA as red on the first array and as 
   green on the second array. The control is green on the first array and red on 
   the second. A second pair of treated and control DNA would use a third and 
   fourth array.</p>
  <p>In contrast, a loop design has overlap between pairs of treated and control 
   DNA. It still uses the first treated DNA sample as red on the first array and 
   green on the second. The first control uses red on the second array and green 
   on the third. The second treated DNA sample is red on the third array and 
   green on the fourth. This continues similarly. The last control DNA sample is 
   red on the last array and green on the first array. The return to the last 
   sample to the first array is the loop design.</p>

   polymorphism is a quantitative variation in gene expression associated with a 
   complex process such as resistance.</p>
  <p STYLE="page-break-after: avoid; margin-bottom: 0cm">Duplicate samples give 
   the biggest boost in power. Triplicates and higher levels of replication 
   provide smaller but still significant gains.</p>
