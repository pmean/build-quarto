<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, How do you analyze a 
  t-test. I have a t-test value, and I know that I have to compare it to a 
 t-distribution. I'm not sure how to do that.</font></em></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">A t-test covers a wide range of tests. It 
  appears when you are <strong>testing whether the mean for a given group has 
    exceeded a certain standard</strong>. It appears when you <strong>compare the 
      means of two different groups</strong>. It also appears in <strong>linear 
        regression models</strong>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">When you t<strong>ake a statistic and dividie 
  by its estiamted variation, which is often known as the standard error</strong>, 
  the result is a t-test. You would compare this t-test to percentiles from a t 
  distribution. Tables of these percentiles are found in the back of most 
  statistical text books.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Most computer software will provide a p-value 
  to accompany the t-test. <strong>A p-value makes the use of t percentile 
    tables unnecessary</strong>.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Short explanation</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">A simple interpretation of the t-test is that 
  it measures <strong>how many standard errors our statistical estimate is from 
    a hypothesized value</strong>. A large positive t-test implies that our 
  estimate is quite a bit larger than the hypothesized value. A large negative 
  t-test implies that our estimate is quite a bit smaller than our hypothesized 
  value.</font></p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">More details</font></strong></p>
<p>The behavior of the t-test depends greatly on how good our standard error 
   is. If we have a very precise estimate of the variation in our statistic, 
   then the t-test has a distribution that is very close to a standard normal 
   distribution. If we have an imprecise estimate of the variation in our 
   statistic, then the t-test will be more variable than a standard normal 
   distribution.</p>
<p>We can quantify how good our standard error is by the <strong>degrees of 
   freedom</strong>. The degrees of freedom is related to <strong>how much data 
   we have</strong> and <strong>how many things we are trying to estimate</strong> 
  with that data.</p>
<p>Here's an example of how a t-test would behave if it had 25 degrees of 
   freedom. Notice that it looks quite a bit like a standard normal 
   distribution.</p>

<p>It looks and behaves quite a bit like a standard normal distibution. Here's 
   a t-distribution with 2 degrees of freedom.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../03/images/ttest22.gif" alt="wpe20.gif (2295 bytes)" WIDTH="480" HEIGHT="366"></p>
<p>It has the same bell-hspaed curve, but notice that the tails of the 
   distribution don't touch the axis, even at plus or minus 4. That means that 
   extreme values are more likely with this t-distribution than the previous 
   one.</p>
<p>Usually, you <strong>compare your t-test with a value from a t-percentile 
   table</strong>. Extreme values of the t-test (for example, a value larger 
   than the 95th percentile) indicate that your statistic is more extreme than 
   you would expect from sampling error. If you get a t-test from computer 
   software like SPSS, then you will usually get a p-value with your t-test. If 
   your p-value is small, that implies that your t-test is more extreme than 
   most percentiles from a t-distribution.</p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Example</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We have a <strong>sample of 30 informational 
  pamphlets</strong>. We record the reading level of each pamphlet and notice 
  that the <strong>average level is 9.8</strong>. We want an average reading 
  level for all the pamphlets that we produce to be at an 8th grade level. It 
  looks like our sample of pamphlets is <strong>writen at a level 1.8 years 
    higher than we want</strong>. But could a deviation of that size be due to 
  sampling error?</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We can use a one-sample t-test in SPSS to 
  check. Select ANALYZE | COMPARE MEANS | ONE-SAMPLE T TEST from the menu. The 
  dialog box appears in Figure 1. Select the variable that you want to test, 
  and insert 8 into the TEST VALUE field. Then click on the OK button. SPSS 
  produces two tables of statistics (see Figure 2).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">SPSS reports <strong>a mean difference 
  of 1.8 and a standard error of 0.53</strong>. If you divide the mean 
  difference by the standard error, you get a <strong>t-test value of 3.380</strong>, 
  which SPSS shows in table 2. SPSS also informs us that the <strong>degrees of 
    freedom is 29</strong> (which for the one-sample t-test is always one less 
  than the smaple size). Looking in any standard textbook, we would find that 
  the<strong> 95th percentile of a t-distribution with 29 degrees of freedom is 
    1.699</strong>. Since our t-test is much larger than 1.699, we would conclude 
  that a deviation as large as 1.8 years is unlikely to arise just by sampling 
  error.</font></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">We could also look at the p-value. Since the 
  p-value is so small (.002), the deviation that we see is unlikely to arise 
  just by sampling error.</font></p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>The t-test is a general test that involves dividing a test statistic by its 
   standard error. The value is then compared to the t-distribution. The 
   t-distribution looks a lot like a normal distribution, but it tends to be 
   more spread out, especially if the degrees of freedom are small.</p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Further reading</font></strong></p>
<p><font face="Times New Roman">Just about any introductory Statistics book 
  will talk about the t-distribution. See, for example, chapter 7 of Rosner's 
  book. There are web pages that will calculate probabilities and percentiles 
  of the t distribution, such as SurfSTAT (click on the TABLES button on the 
  main page).</font></p>
