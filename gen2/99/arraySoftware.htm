<p><strong>Software for microarray data analysis (no date)</strong> [incomplete]</p>

<p>This page is moving to a <a href="http://new.pmean.com/micro-array-software/">new website</a>.</p>

<p><b>R and the Bioconductor package</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is a wide range of software available for the analysis of microarrays. 
   I will use Bioconductor which is a set of libraries for a statistical 
   programming language called R. Both Bioconductor and R are open source, which 
   means that you can obtain the pacakge at no cost. Open source also means that 
   you can modify the program, if you are so inclined, to add new features. Most 
   of us (myself especially) do not have the programming skills to modify 
   Bioconductor or R, but there are scores of graduate students and faculty who 
   do have this skill and who open source software as a way to quickly publicize 
   and promote their research. As a result, R and Bioconductor have some of the 
   best and most cutting edge analysis methods around.</p>
  <p>Instructions for setting up R on your computer are on the web at</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="http://www.r-project.org/">http://www.r-project.org/</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p>For Windows users, this simply means downloading and running an install 
   program. To install Bioconductor, type in the following two commands:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>source(&quot;http://www.bioconductor.org/getBioC.R&quot;)</li>
    <li>getBioC()</li>
  </ul>
  <p>This will get the default set of packages. You can install a particular set 
   of packages, such as the &quot;affy&quot; packages by typing in</p>
  <ul>
    <li>getBioC(libName=&quot;affy&quot;)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>and if you have a high speed connection and some free time,&nbsp; you can 
   download the entire Bioconductor system by typing</p>
  <ul>
    <li>getBioC(libName=&quot;all&quot;)</li>
  </ul>
