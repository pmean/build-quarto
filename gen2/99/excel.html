<p><em><font face="Times New Roman">Dear Professor Mean, </font>I need to import 
 data in an Excel spreadsheet, but I can't get SPSS to read this data properly. 
 Can you help? -- Stumped Stan</em></p>
<p>Dear Stumped,</p>
<p>Nothing works right the first time, but you can do a few things that will 
   make it easier to import your Excel data. Every data set has its own unique 
   problems, of course, so <strong>there is no foolproof way to ensure that your 
   data will move perfectly</strong>.</p>
<p>Here are the four general steps that I recommend for someone who is 
   importing Excel data.</p>
<ol>
  <li><b>Close the Excel file</b> before you try to import in SPSS. </li>
  <li>Arrange the data in a <strong>rectangular grid</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Don't mix</strong> strings and numbers.</li>
  <li>Put <strong>descriptive names</strong> in your first row.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>Rectangular grid</b></p>
<p>A rectangular gird is a systematic layout of your data so that that 
   the intersection of every column and row contains a single number. 
   The data should start in the first row of the spreadsheet, or the second row, 
   if you use the first row as column labels. Don't leave any &quot;holes&quot; in the 
   spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Be sure to delete any rows of your spreadsheet that contains 
   summary data like totals or means. You don't want SPSS to think that 
   this summary row is just another row of data.</p>
<b>
<p>Don't mix strings and numbers.</p></b>
<p>A mixture of strings and numbers in a single column will confuse SPSS.  SPSS uses the first value that it sees in a column to decide if that column 
  should be stored using string, date, or numeric format. If any further values 
  in that column do not match the format of your first value, SPSS will convert 
  that value to missing.<b></p>
<p>Here's an example of a mixture of strings and numbers &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3 or 
   more&quot;. This type of coding will ensure that a large amount of your data 
   gets converted to missing values. Which values stay and which ones don't 
   depend on what appears first in your column.</p>
<p><b>Provide brief descriptive names</b></p>
<p>SPSS can use the first row of your spreadsheet as variable names, 
   as long as you keep within the proper restrictions. Keep you names 
   short. Although the previous restriction to eight characters or less, names 
   that are very long become unwieldy and don't display well in the graphs and 
   tables. You can (and should) use the variable label in SPSS to provide a 
   longer and more detailed description of this variable.</p>
<p>The name has to be one word with no blanks. You can use the underscore 
   symbol &quot;_&quot; or the dot to simulate blanks. You can also use 
   MixedCapitalization to simulate blanks.</p>
<p>Avoid special symbols (other than the underscore and dot). Symbols like the 
   dash (-) and the slash (/) cause problems because they imply some sort of 
   arithmetic operation.</p>
<p>A variable name like &quot;Mother's Age&quot; causes problems because it 
   includes a special symbol (the apostrophe) and it has a blank. If 
   you tried to use this name, SPSS would create a generic name like VAR00001 
   and use &quot;Mother's Age&quot; as a variable label. A name that SPSS will tolerate 
   would be &quot;mom_age&quot; or &quot;MomAge&quot; or &quot;mom.age&quot;.</p>
<p>It takes some creativity to describe a variable well with only 
   eight characters. Do the best you can. Remember that you can always 
   add a lengthy variable label later that has blanks, special symbols.</p>
<p><strong><font face="Times New Roman">Close the Excel file</font></strong></p>
<p>SPSS cannot import data from a spreadsheet that is currently open in Excel. Excel marks that spreadsheet as &quot;in use&quot; and SPSS avoids importing anything with such a mark. This actually provides an extra level of security, as you probably would not want to import data into SPSS that was possibly being editted in Excel at the same time.</p>

  from a breast feeding study</strong>. I have already arranged the data in a 
  rectangular grid and placed brief descriptive names in the first row..</font></p>

<p><strong>Make sure that Excel is closed before you try to import in SPSS</strong>. 
   SPSS is very jealous. It will not want to open your data file if it knows 
   that some other software is currently using it. SPSS will warn you about a 
  &quot;sharing violation&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Open SPSS and select FILE | OPEN from the menu</strong>. Here is 
   the SPSS dialog box that you will see. Click on the down arrow in the FILE OF 
   TYPE field and select the EXCEL (*.XLS) option. Find your file on the proper 
   drive and folder of your computer.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../02/images/excel02.gif"></p>
<p>When you click on the OPEN button, you get the dialog box shown below.
  <strong>Click on the READ VARIABLE NAMES BUTTON if the first row of your 
  spreadsheet has variable names</strong>. Then click on the OK button.</p>
<p><img border="0" src="../02/images/excel03.gif"></p>
<p><strong>Check if you got the correct number of variables (columns) and 
   cases (rows)</strong>. A common problem is that SPSS will sometimes import a 
   bunch of extra blank rows. You can delete the blank rows manually.</p>

<p>Here is what the SPSS data window looks like. <strong>We are now ready to 
   do things like adjusting the number of decimal places displayed and adding 
   documentation.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>If you want to import Microsoft Excel data into SPSS, follow these four 
   steps:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Close the Excel file</li>
  <li>Arrange the data in a <strong>rectangular grid</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Don't mix</strong> strings and numbers.</li>
  <li>Put <strong>descriptive names</strong> in your first row.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once you have done this, s<strong>elect FILE | OPEN DATA</strong> from the 
   SPSS menu. Then <strong>click on FILE OF TYPE field and select the EXCEL (*.XLS) 
   option</strong>.</p>
