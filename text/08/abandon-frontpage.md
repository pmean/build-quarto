This page is obsolete, but I am keeping it around for sentimental reasons. **Note: 2025-07-19**. I did try KompoZer and it was okay, but ended up using other software. I am not sure if KompoZer is still available.

I've used various iterations of Microsoft FrontPage since the beginning of the StATS website (that site started in 1998, but the first "surviving" page dates from 1999). I like FrontPage, but I'm wondering if I should switch to an open source package.

An open source package would simplify my life quite a bit. Microsoft itself no longer produces FrontPage and recommends that users purchase Microsoft Expression Studio. Since my pages are, by design, very minimalist, I'm not sure I want all the fancy bells and whistles that come with Expression Studio (or even FrontPage).

A nice system recommended at the Open Source Alternative website is KompoZer.
