::: notes
I am using R in my Biostatistics classes, but I encourage students to use a different package if they prefer. One of my students was using Python and produced an ANOVA table that wasn't quite right. I did not know what to suggest, but found this nice chapter in a book on Statistics that used Python in all of its examples. The writing in this particular chapter looks quite good and the coding example was easy to follow. If the rest of the book is as good, it might be a nice resource to recommend.


Danielle Navarro, Ethan Weed. "Chapter 17, Factorial ANOVA" in Learning Statistics With Python. Available in [html format][ref-navarro-2021].

I asked my students as an extra credit assignment to review some open source textbooks. Here are the suggestions that they made.

-   Introductory Biostatistics with R; Authors: Dylan Z. Childs, Bethan J. Hindle, and Philip H. Warren
-   Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS) second edition. Mine Çetinkaya‑Rundel and Johanna Hardin
-   Biostatistics: A Foundation for Analysis in the Health Sciences by Daniel and Cross
-   OpenIntro Statistics by David Diez, Christopher Barr, and Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel.
-   An Intuitive, Interactive Introduction to Biostatistics by Caitlin E. Ward and Collin Nolte.
