Starting on July 15, 2008, I am available for statistical consulting. I have a PhD in Statistics, thirty years of experience, and many satisfied customers. In the past, I have undertaken independent consulting assignments using my evenings and weekends, but there was not enough time in the week to handle this and keep up with my six year old boy. I am now available full time and can provide you with help on your toughest statistical problems.

Rates

It's a bad idea to list rates on a webpage because it will scare people away. I charge 250 U.S. dollars per hour of consulting. Here's what I can do to avoid a bit of the sticker shock.

Offer the first hour for free in any consulting project. I've always done this, and I like this policy as it allows you to explore what services I can provide at no risk. It also helps me to understand the scope of the problem so that I can estimate the total amount of time required.
Place an upper limit on the hours worked in any consulting project. Once I understand your problem, I will tell you the maximum number of hours that the project will require. If it requires more hours, I will provide those at no cost. If I work less hours than the maximum, you pay less.
Offer special discounts for specific projects. If you will let me use your data as a teaching example on my website (with appropriate safeguards for anonymity, of course), then I will provide consulting for $75 less than my normal hourly rate. If you are a graduate student working on a thesis or dissertation, I will provide consulting for $75 less than my normal consulting rate because I remember what it was like to be a poor struggling graduate student. These discounts can be combined.
Review the going rates for statistical consultants. A report in the Spring 2006 issue of The Statistical Consultant reports a salary survey for statistical consultants. They noted that "the median hourly rate charged for external clients is $130 with an inter quartile range of $89 - $189" and "Ph.D.'s charge on average $44 more per hour than those with a Master's degree across all types of tasks." Prices, undoubtedly, have gone up since 2006.
What can I help with?

Statistical consulting usually covers four stages of research, the initial planning stage, the data collection stage, the data analysis stage, and the reporting stage. I also have expertise in Evidence Based Health Care and in research ethics. Here's a list (though not an exhaustive list) of the ways I can help.

Initial planning.

defining an appropriate research hypothesis,
developing a plan for early stopping of a trial,
selecting an appropriate sample size,
submitting a protocol for ethical review,
preparing randomization tables,
Data collection.

selecting an appropriate system for data entry,
monitoring accrual rates to keep project on time,
evaluating conditions that might call for early termination.
Data analysis.

choosing software appropriate for your analysis needs,
screening data for obvious errors,
producing simple descriptive statistics,
assessing reliability and validity,
fitting a linear, logistic, or Poisson regression model,
analyzing time-to-event data (survival curves).
Reporting.

documenting the statistical methods used in the data analysis,
producing graphs and tables that are easily comprehended,
preparing bibliographic entries relevant to the statistical analysis.
Evidence Based Health Care.

preparing a critical review of a research article.
Research ethics.

outlining the limitations on the use of randomization, blinding, and placebos.
Are you interested in a short course or seminar?

I have developed a whole series of classes about data analysis, research design, evidence-based medicine, and research ethics that I can teach for a small fee. I am also hoping to develop some web seminars on these topics.

Interested?
